<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>Outward Bound is the first volume of "A Library of
Travel and Adventure in Foreign Lands," and contains the
voyage of the Academy Ship "Young America" across the
Atlantic. The origin and progress of this aquatic institution
are incidentally developed, and the plan is respectfully submitted
to the consideration of those who are interested in
the education and moral training of the class of young men
who are the characters in the scenes described in this work.
Besides a full description of the routine and discipline of the
ship, as an educational and reformatory institution, the volume
contains a rather free <i>expos&eacute;</i> of the follies and frailties
of youth, but their vices are revealed to suggest the remedy.</p>

<p>The story includes the experience of the officers and crew
of the Young America, eighty-seven in number, though, of
course, only a few of them can appear as prominent actors.
As the ship has a little world, with all the elements of good
and evil, within her wooden walls, the story of the individual
will necessarily be interwoven with that of the mass; and
the history of "The Chain League," in the present volume,
of which Shuffles is the hero, will, it is hoped, convey an
instructive lesson to young men who are disposed to rebel
against reasonable discipline and authority.</p>

<p><span class="pageno"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>{6}</span>
In the succeeding volumes of this series, the adventures,
travels, and "sight-seeing," as well as the individual and
collective experience of the juvenile crew of the Academy
Ship, will be narrated. They will visit the principal ports
of Europe, as well as penetrate to the interior; but they
will always be American boys, wherever they are.</p>

<p>The author hopes that the volumes of the series will not
only be instructive as a description of foreign lands, and
interesting as a record of juvenile exploits, but that they
will convey correct views of moral and social duties, and
stimulate the young reader to their faithful performance.</p>

<p>"There are no such peaches this side of New
Jersey; and you can't get them, for love or
money, at the stores. All we have to do is, to fill
our pockets, and keep our mouths closed&mdash;till the
peaches are ripe enough to eat," said Robert Shuffles,
the older and the larger of two boys, who had just
climbed over the high fence that surrounded the fine
garden of Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>"What will Baird say if he finds it out?" replied
Isaac Monroe, his companion.</p>

<p>"Baird," the gentleman thus irreverently alluded
to, was the principal of the Brockway Academy, of
which Shuffles and Monroe were pupils in the boarding
department.</p>

<p>"What will he say when he finds out that the King
of the Tonga Islands picks his teeth with a pitch
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>fork?"
added Shuffles, contemptuously. "I don't intend
that he shall find it out? and he won't, unless
you tell him."</p>

<p>"Of course, I shall not tell him."</p>

<p>"Come along, then? it is nearly dark, and no one
will see us."</p>

<p>Shuffles led the way down the gravelled walk, till
he came to a brook, on the bank of which stood the
peach tree whose rich fruit had tempted the young
gentlemen to invade the territory of Mr. Lowington
with intent to plunder.</p>

<p>"There they are," said the chief of the young
marauders, as he paused behind a clump of quince
bushes, and pointed at the coveted fruit. "There's
no discount on them, and they are worth coming
after."</p>

<p>"Hark!" whispered Monroe. "I heard a noise."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm afraid we shall be caught."</p>

<p>"No danger; no one can see us from the house."</p>

<p>"But I'm sure there's some one near. I heard
something."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! It was only a dagger of the mind,
such as Baird talks about," answered Shuffles, as he
crawled towards the peach tree. "Come, Monroe,
be quick, and fill your pockets."</p>

<p>This peach tree was a choice variety, in whose
cultivation the owner had been making an elaborate
experiment. Mr. Lowington had watched it and
nursed it with the most assiduous care, and now it
bore about a dozen remarkably large and beautiful
peaches. They were not quite ripe enough to be
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
gathered, but Shuffles was confident that they would
"mellow" in his trunk as well as on the tree. The
experiment of the cultivator had been a success, and
he had already prepared, with much care and labor, a
paper explanatory of the process, which he intended
to read before the Pomological Society, exhibiting
the fruit as the evidence of the practicability of his
method. To Mr. Lowington, therefore, the peaches
had a value far beyond their intrinsic worth.</p>

<p>Shuffles gathered a couple of the peaches, and urged
his companion to use all possible haste in stripping
the tree of its rich burden.</p>

<p>"Hallo, there! What are you about?" shouted
some one, who hastened to make his presence known
to the plunderers.</p>

<p>Monroe began to retreat.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" interposed Shuffles. "It's no one but
Harry Martyn."</p>

<p>"He can tell of us just as well as anybody else."</p>

<p>"If he does, he will catch it."</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" demanded Harry Martyn,&mdash;who
was a nephew of Mr. Lowington, and lived
with him,&mdash;as he crossed the rustic bridge that
spanned the brook.</p>

<p>"Don't you see what I'm doing?" replied Shuffles,
with an impudent coolness which confounded Harry.</p>

<p>"Stop that, Shuffles!" cried Harry, indignantly.
"My uncle wouldn't take ten dollars apiece for those
peaches."</p>

<p>"That's more than he'll get for them," added Shuffles,
as he reached up and gathered another peach.</p>

<p>"Stop that, I tell you!" said Harry, angrily, as he
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
stepped up, in a menacing attitude, before the reckless
marauder.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Harry! You know me, and when I get
all these peaches, I've got something to say to you."</p>

<p>Shuffles was about to gather another of the peaches,
when Harry, his indignation overcoming his prudence,
grasped his arm, and pulled him away from the tree.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Harry Martyn?" exclaimed
Shuffles, apparently astonished at the temerity of the
youth. "I can't stop to lick you now; but I'll do it
within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you touch those peaches, then."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will touch them. I intend to have the
whole of them; and if you say a word to your uncle
or any one else about it, I'll pulverize that head of
yours."</p>

<p>"No, you won't! You shall not have those peaches,
anyhow," replied the resolute little fellow, who was
no match, physically, for Shuffles.</p>

<p>"If you open your mouth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hallo! Uncle Robert! Help, help! Thieves in
the garden!" shouted Harry, who certainly had no
defect of the lungs.</p>

<p>"Take that, you little monkey!" said Shuffles,
angrily, as he struck the little fellow a heavy blow
on the side of the head with his fist, which knocked
him down. "I'll fix you the next, time I see you."</p>

<p>Shuffles consulted his discretion rather than his
valor, now that the alarm had been given, and retreated
towards the place where he had entered
garden.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Harry?" asked Mr. Lowington,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
as he rushed over the bridge, followed by the gardener
and his assistants, just as Harry was picking himself
up and rubbing his head.</p>

<p>"They were stealing your peaches, and I tried to
stop them," replied Harry. "They have taken some
of them now."</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington glanced at the favorite tree, and his
brow lowered with anger and vexation. His paper
before the "Pomological" could be illustrated by
only nine peaches, instead of thirteen.</p>

<p>"Who stole them, Harry?" demanded the disappointed
fruit-grower.</p>

<p>The nephew hesitated a moment, and the question
was repeated with more sternness.</p>

<p>"Robert Shuffles; Isaac Monroe was with him, but
he didn't take any of the peaches."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with your head, Harry?"
asked his uncle, when he observed him rubbing the
place where the blow had fallen.</p>

<p>"Shuffles struck me and knocked me down, when I
called out for you."</p>

<p>"Did he? Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He and Monroe ran up the walk to the back of
the garden."</p>

<p>"That boy shall be taken care of," continued Mr.
Lowington, as he walked up the path towards the
point where the marauders had entered. "The Academy
is fast becoming a nuisance to the neighborhood,
because there is neither order nor discipline among
the students."</p>

<p>The thieves had escaped, and as it would be useless
to follow them, Mr. Lowington went back to the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
house; but he was too much annoyed at the loss of
his splendid peaches, which were to figure so prominently
before the "Pomological," to permit the matter
to drop without further notice.</p>

<p>"Did he hurt you much, Harry?" asked Mr. Lowington
as they entered the house.</p>

<p>"Not much, sir, though he gave me a pretty hard
crack," answered Harry.</p>

<p>"Did you see them when they came into the
garden?"</p>

<p>"No, sir? I was fixing my water-wheel in the
brook, when I heard them at the tree. I went up,
and tried to prevent Shuffles from taking the peaches.
I caught hold of him, and pulled him away. He said
he couldn't stop to lick me then, but he'd do it within
twenty-four hours. Then he hit me when I called for
help."</p>

<p>"The young scoundrel! That boy is worse than a
pestilence in any neighborhood. Mr. Baird seems to
have no control over him."</p>

<p>Suddenly, and without any apparent reason, Mr.
Lowington's compressed lips and contracted brow
relaxed, and his face wore its usual expression of
dignified serenity. Harry could not understand the
cause of this sudden change; but his uncle's anger
had passed away. The fact was, that Mr. Lowington
happened to think, while his indignation prompted
him to resort to the severest punishment for Shuffles,
that he himself had been just such a boy as the plunderer
of his cherished fruit. At the age of fifteen he
had been the pest of the town in which he resided.
His father was a very wealthy man, and resorted
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
to many expedients to cure the boy of his vicious
propensities.</p>

<p>Young Lowington had a taste for the sea, and his
father finally procured a midshipman's warrant for
him to enter the navy. The strict discipline of a ship
of war proved to be the "one thing needful" for the
reformation of the wild youth; and he not only
became a steady young man, but a hard student and
an accomplished officer. The navy made a man of
him, as it has of hundreds of the sons of rich men,
demoralized by idleness and the absence of a reasonable
ambition.</p>

<p>When Mr. Lowington was thirty years old, his
father died, leaving to each of his three children a
quarter of a million; and he had resigned his position
in the navy, in order to take care of his property,
and to lead a more domestic life with his wife and
daughter than the discipline of the service would
permit.</p>

<p>He had taken up his residence in Brockway, the
early home of his wife. It was a large town on the
sea shore, only a few miles from the metropolis of
New England, thus combining all the advantages of a
home in the city and in the country. For several
years he had been happy in his peaceful retirement.
But not wealth, nor even integrity and piety, can bar
the door of the lofty mansion against the Destroyer of
the race. His wife died of an hereditary disease, which
gave no indication of its presence till she had passed
her thirtieth year. Two years later, his daughter,
just blooming into maturity, followed her mother
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
down to the silent tomb, stricken in her freshness
and beauty by the same insidious malady.</p>

<p>The husband and father was left desolate. His
purest and fondest hopes were blighted; but, while
he was submissive to the will of the Father, who
doeth all things well, he became gloomy and sad.
He was not seen to smile for a year after the death of
his daughter, and it was three years before he had
recovered even the outward semblance of his former
cheerfulness. He was rich, but alone in the world.
He continued to reside in the home which was endeared
to him by the memories of his loved and
lost ones.</p>

<p>When his wife's sister died in poverty, leaving two
children, he had taken them to his home, and had
become a father to them. Harry Martyn was a good
boy, and Josephine Martyn was a good girl; but they
were not his own children. There was something
wanting&mdash;an aching void which they could not fill,
though Mr. Lowington was to them all that could be
asked or expected of a parent.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington busied himself in various studies
and experiments; but life had ceased to be what it
was before the death of his wife and daughter. He
wanted more mental occupation; he felt the need of
greater activity, and he was tempted to return to the
navy, even after his absence of ten years from the
service; but this step, for many reasons, was not
practicable. At the time when his garden was invaded
by the vandal students from the Brockway
Academy, he was still thinking what he could do to
save himself from the inglorious life of ease he was
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
leading, and, at the same time, serve his country and
his race.</p>

<p>Shuffles had robbed his garden of some of his
choicest fruit; had struck his nephew a severe blow
on the head, and threatened to inflict still greater
chastisement upon him in the future. Mr. Lowington
was justly indignant; and his own peace and the
peace of the neighborhood demanded that the author
of the mischief should be punished, especially as he
was an old transgressor. It was absolutely necessary
that something should be done, and the retired naval
officer was in the right frame of mind to do it. Just
then, when he was wrought up to the highest pitch of
indignation, his anger vanished. Shuffles at sixteen
was the counterpart of himself at fifteen.</p>

<p>This was certainly no reason why the hand of justice
should be stayed. Mr. Lowington did not intend
to stay it, though the thought of his own juvenile
depravity modified his view, and appeased his wrath.
He put on his hat and left the house. He walked
over to the Academy, and being shown to the office
of the principal, he informed him of the depredations
committed in his garden.</p>

<p>"Who did it, Mr. Lowington?" demanded the
principal, with proper indignation in his tones and
his looks.</p>

<p>"Shuffles."</p>

<p>"I need not have asked. That boy gives me more
trouble than all the others put together," added Mr.
Baird, with an anxious expression. "And yet what
can I do with him?"</p>

<p>"Expel him," replied Mr. Lowington, laconically.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't like to do that."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It would be an injury to me."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"It would offend his father, who is a person of
wealth and influence. When Shuffles came to Brockway
ten other boys came with him. He was expelled
from another institution, which so incensed his father
that he induced the parents of ten others to take their
sons out, and send them to me. If I expel Shuffles, I
shall lose about a dozen of my students, and I can't
afford to do that."</p>

<p>"But must the neighborhood suffer from his depredations?"</p>

<p>"I will talk with the boy; I will keep him in his
room for a week."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the boy needs severer measures. If
this were the first, or even the third time, I would, not
say so much."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, what can I do?"</p>

<p>"The boy needs strict discipline. If I were still in
the navy, and had him aboard my ship, I could make
a man of him."</p>

<p>"I don't think anything can be done."</p>

<p>"Something must be done, Mr. Baird. My garden
shall not be robbed with impunity."</p>

<p>"I will do what I can, Mr. Lowington."</p>

<p>But the owner of the stolen fruit was by this time
satisfied that nothing would be done. The principal
of the Brockway Academy had not force nor influence
enough to control such a boy as Shuffles. Mr. Lowington
took his leave, determined to apply to another
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
tribunal for the correction of the evil. That night the
peach thieves were arrested, and put in the lock-up.
The next day they were tried, found guilty, and sentenced
to pay a fine and costs, which Mr. Baird
promptly paid. Within a week Mr. Lowington's
stable was burned to the ground. Shuffles was seen
near the building just before the fire broke out; but it
could not be proved that he was the incendiary, though
no one doubted the fact. He was arrested, but discharged
on the examination.</p>

<p>"You see how it is, Mr. Lowington," said the
principal of the Academy, as the two gentlemen met
after the examination. "It would have been better
for you if you had not prosecuted the boy for stealing
the peaches."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied Mr. Lowington. "I
must do my duty, without regard to consequences;
and you will pardon me if I say you ought to do the
same."</p>

<p>"If I expel the boy he would burn the house over
my head."</p>

<p>"Then you think he burned my stable?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; it cannot be proved that he did."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of the fact. I have no ill will
against the boy. I only desire to protect myself and
my neighbors from his depredations."</p>

<p>"I think you were very unfortunate in the method
you adopted, Mr. Lowington," replied the principal
of the Academy. "It has reacted upon yourself."</p>

<p>"Shall this boy steal my fruit and burn my buildings
with impunity?" added Mr. Lowington, with
considerable warmth.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"I applied to you for redress, Mr. Baird."</p>

<p>"I told you I would talk with the boy."</p>

<p>"Such a reprobate as that needs something more
than talk."</p>

<p>"What would you do with him, sir?" demanded
Mr. Baird, earnestly.</p>

<p>"I hardly know. I should certainly have expelled
him; but that, while it protects the Academy, does not
benefit the boy."</p>

<p>"It would only harden the boy."</p>

<p>"Very likely; and his remaining will harden a
dozen more by his influence. Mr. Baird, I shall be
obliged to take my nephew out of your institution,"
added Mr. Lowington, seriously.</p>

<p>"Take him out?"</p>

<p>"I must, indeed."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked Mr Baird, who was touched in
a very tender place.</p>

<p>"Because I am not willing to keep him under the
influence of such an example as this Shuffles sets for
his companions. As the matter now stands, the young
rascal has more influence in the Academy than you
have. You cannot manage him, and you dare not
expel him. The boy knows this, and he will not
leave his advantage unused."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't take Harry out of the school,"
said Mr. Baird.</p>

<p>"I must."</p>

<p>"Others may do the same."</p>

<p>"I cannot help it; with my view of the matter,
they can hardly do otherwise."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
</p>

<p>"But you see, sir, what the effect of this step
must be."</p>

<p>"Mr. Baird, I must be frank with you. You have
declined to expel Shuffles, while you know that his
influence is bad. You asked me what you should do?
and I told you. Now, you prefer to retain Shuffles,
but you must lose others. Permit me to say that you
should do your duty without regard to consequences."</p>

<p>"I cannot afford to lose my scholars."</p>

<p>"Your position is a difficult one. I grant, Mr. Baird;
but without discipline you can do nothing for yourself
or the boys."</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington went home, Harry was taken from
the Academy, and a dozen parents and guardians followed
the example of the advocate for discipline. Mr.
Baird was in despair. The institution was falling to
pieces for the want of discipline. The principal had
not the nerve to enforce order, even with the limited
means within his reach. He went to see Mr. Lowington
and begged him to assist in stemming the tide
which was setting against the Brockway Academy.
The retired naval officer became deeply interested in
the subject of school discipline in general, especially
in its connection with the education of rich men's sons
given to insubordination. He pitied poor Mr. Baird
in his perplexities, for he was a good man and an
excellent teacher.</p>

<p>In the mean time Shuffles grew worse instead of
better. Finding that he could have his own way, that
the principal was no match for him, his influence for
evil was stronger than Mr. Baird's for good. The
worthy schoolmaster had finally resolved to expel his
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
troublesome student, when Mr. Lowington one day
surprised him by offering to buy out the Academy at
a price far exceeding its value. He gladly accepted
the offer as the best solution of the problem, and
the naval officer became principal of the Brockway
Academy.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington did not expel the refractory pupil at
once. He waited for an overt act; but Shuffles found
the anaconda of authority tightening upon him. He
attempted to vindicate himself before his fellow-students
by setting fire to a haystack on the marsh,
belonging to the new principal. A searching investigation
followed, and Shuffles was convicted. Mr.
Lowington wrote to the boy's father, announcing his
expulsion. Mr. Shuffles went to Brockway full of
wrath, and threatened the new head of the institution
with the loss of a large number of his scholars if he
disgraced his son by expelling him. If the boy had
done wrong,&mdash;and he supposed he had,&mdash;let him be
talked to; let him be confined to his room for a day or
two; but he must not be expelled; it was a disgrace
to the boy.</p>

<p>The principal was as firm as a rock, and Mr. Shuffles
was calm when he found that threats were unavailing.
Mr. Lowington pointed out to his visitor the
perils which lay in the path of his son. Mr. Shuffles
began to be reasonable, and dined with the principal.
A long and earnest consideration of the whole matter
took place over the dessert. The fiat of expulsion was
revoked, and young Shuffles was turned over to the
ex-naval officer, with full power to discipline him as
he thought best. Mr. Lowington had converted the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
father, and he hoped he should be able to convert
the son.</p>

<p>After dinner, Mr. Shuffles went down the bay with
his host in the yacht. On the way they passed the
school ship Massachusetts, to which boys are sentenced
by the courts for crime and vagrancy, and on board of
which they are disciplined and educated. Mr. Lowington
explained the institution to his guest.</p>

<p>"An excellent idea," said Mr. Shuffles.</p>

<p>"It is just the place for your son," replied Mr.
Lowington.</p>

<p>"But it is for criminals."</p>

<p>"Very true."</p>

<p>"Robert is not a criminal."</p>

<p>"If he is not now, he soon will be, if he continues
in his present course. If I had him on shipboard, I
could make a man of him."</p>

<p>"Then I wish you had him on shipboard."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may yet," replied the principal, with a
smile. "I did not purchase the Academy with the
intention of becoming a pedagogue, in the ordinary
sense of the word. I have no intention of remaining
in it."</p>

<p>"I hope you will."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking of fitting up a vessel like the
school ship, that rich men's sons may have the benefit
of such an institution without the necessity of committing
a crime. I could do more for the boys in
a month on board ship than I could in a year at
Brockway."</p>

<p>This was the first mention which Mr. Lowington
made of his plan, though he had been considering
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
it for several weeks. Mr. Shuffles hoped that this
idea of a nautical academy would be reduced to practice;
for he now felt that it was just what his son
needed. The project was discussed during the rest of
the trip.</p>

<p>The history of the scheme, from its inception, need
not be followed in detail. Many persons were consulted
in regard to it; there were plenty to approve,
and plenty to disapprove; but in October the keel of
a four hundred ton ship was laid down. The object
of this marine institution was thoroughly explained,
and before the ship was ready for launching there
were applications for every berth on board of her.</p>

<p>The idea was exceedingly popular among the boys,
all of whom were anxious to be students on board,
especially as it was already hinted that the ship would
visit Europe. To parents it held out for their sons all
the benefits of a sea voyage, with few of its disadvantages.
It would furnish healthy exercise and a
vigorous constitution to its pupils.</p>

<p>In March of the following year the ship was at
anchor in Brockway harbor, ready to receive her
juvenile crew.

<h4>THE YOUNG AMERICA.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>With Mr. Lowington, the Academy Ship, which
was the name he usually applied to the idea
he had matured, and thus far carried into effect, was
not a speculation; he did not intend to see how much
money could be made by the scheme. It was an experiment
in the education of rich men's sons, for only
rich men could pay for scholarships in such an expensive
institution.</p>

<p>The Brockway Academy was to be continued, under
the management of a board of trustees. An accomplished
teacher had been selected by Mr. Lowington,
and the school, under its present administration, was
in a highly prosperous condition. Only ten of its
pupils had been transferred to the Academy Ship, for
it required no little nerve on the part of parents to
send their sons to school on the broad ocean, to battle
with the elements, to endure the storms of the Atlantic,
and to undergo the hardships which tender mothers
supposed to be inseparably connected with a life on
shipboard.</p>

<p>For six months Mr. Lowington had studied upon
his plan, and it was hardly matured when the new
ship came to anchor in Brockway harbor. During
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
this period he had visited the principal cities of the
Northern States, those of the southern section being
closed against his operations by the war of the rebellion
then raging at the height of its fury. He had
interested his friends in his bold enterprise, and boys
with, whom the experiment was to be inaugurated were
gathered from all parts of the country.</p>

<p>The securing of the requisite number of pupils was
the first success, and what he had regarded as the
most difficult part of the enterprise. More than half
of them had been obtained before it was deemed
prudent to lay the keel of the ship. The details of
the plan had been carefully considered during the
winter, and when the ship was moored at Brockway,
the organization of the school, its rules and regulations
had all been written out. The boys began to
arrive about the first of March, and by the first of April
all of them, eighty-seven in number, were on board.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington was naturally very anxious for the
success of his experiment, and for months he had
labored with unceasing diligence in perfecting his
plan, and carrying it into operation. In this occupation
he had found the activity he needed; and he
may not be blamed for believing, all the time, that he
was laboring for his country and his race.</p>

<p>If it has been inferred from what has been said of
Mr. Lowington, of his domestic afflictions, and of his
views on the subject of discipline, that he was an austere,
cold, and unsympathizing man, a wrong impression
has been conveyed. The boys of the Brockway
Academy, when they came to know him, loved him as
much as they respected him. He was not the man
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
needlessly to abridge the harmless enjoyment of youth,
or to repress its innocent hilarity. He watched the
sports of the students with interest and pleasure, and
encouraged them by all the means in his power. He
was fond of humor, enjoyed a harmless joke, and had
a keen appreciation of juvenile wit. He was a good
companion for the boys, and when they understood
him, he was always welcome to the play-ground.</p>

<p>The new ship had been duly christened Young
America at the launching, by Miss Josey Martyn&mdash;a
name which was rapturously applauded by the boys.
She was one hundred and eighteen feet in length, and
of about four hundred tons burden. She had been
built as strong as wood, iron, and copper could make
her. For a ship, she was small, which permitted her
to be light sparred, so that her juvenile crew could
handle her with the more ease. She had a flush deck;
that is, it was unbroken from stem to stern. There
was no cabin, poop, camboose, or other house on
deck, and the eye had a clean range over the whole
length of her. There was a skylight between the fore
and the main mast, and another between the main and
mizzen masts, to afford light and air to the apartments
below. There were three openings in the deck by
which entrance could be obtained to the interior of the
ship: the fore hatch, the main hatch, and the companion-way,
the two former being used by the crew,
and the latter by the officers.</p>

<p>The between-decks, which is the space included
between the upper and the lower deck, was fitted up
for the accommodation of the officers and crew.
Descending by the companion-way&mdash;which in the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
Young America extended athwartships&mdash;on the right,
at the foot of the stairs, was the officers' cabin, occupying
the part of the ship nearest to the stern. This
apartment was twenty-eight feet long, by fifteen in
breadth at the widest part, with four state rooms on
each side. The mizzen mast passed up through the
middle of it. This cabin was richly but plainly fitted
up, and was furnished well enough for a drawing-room
on shore. It was for the use of the juvenile
officers of the ship, fifteen in number, who were to
hold their positions as rewards of merit. The captain
had a room to himself, while each of the other apartments
was to accommodate two officers.</p>

<p>On the left of the companion-way, descending the
stairs, was the "old folks' cabin," as it was called by
the students. It was in the locality corresponding to
that occupied by the ward room of a man-of-war.
Though the after cabin is the place of honor on board
a ship, Mr. Lowington had selected the ward room for
himself and the teachers, in preference to the after
cabin, because it was next to the steerage, which was
occupied by the larger portion of the pupils, and
because the form of the ship did not contract the dimensions
of the state rooms. This cabin was twenty-two
feet long and fifteen feet wide, with no waste room,
as in the after cabin, caused by the rounding in of the
ship's counter. On the sides were five state rooms,
besides a pantry for the steward, and a dispensary for
the surgeon.</p>

<p>The forward room on the starboard side was occupied
by Mr. Lowington alone; the next on the same
side by the chaplain and doctor; and each of the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
three on the port side by two of the teachers. This
cabin was elegantly finished and furnished, and the
professors were delighted with its cheerful and pleasant
aspect.</p>

<p>From the main cabin, as that of the "faculty" was
called, were two doors, opening into the steerage,
fifty-two feet in length by fifteen feet in width of clear
space between the berths, which diminished to nine
feet abreast of the foremast. This apartment was
eight feet high, and was lighted in part by a large
skylight midway between the fore and main mast, and
partly by bull's eyes in the side of the ship. There
were seventy-two berths, placed in twelve rooms,
opening from passage-ways, which extended athwartships
from the main steerage, and were lighted by the
bull's eyes. There were no doors to these dormitories,
each of which contained six berths, in two tiers of
three each. It was intended that the six boys occupying
one of these rooms should form a mess. Between
the gangways, or passages, were mess tables, which
could be swung up against the partition when not
in use.</p>

<p>The steerage was neatly and tastefully fitted up, and
furnished, though not so elegantly as the cabins. It
was to be the school room, as well as the parlor and
dining room of the boys, and it would compare favorably
with such apartments in well-ordered academies
on shore. There was plenty of shelves, pouches, and
lockers, under the lower berths, and beneath the bull's
eyes at the head of the main gangways, for clothing
and books, and each boy had a place for every article
which regulations allowed him to possess.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span></p>

<p>Forward of the foremast there were two large
state rooms; that on the starboard side having four
berths, for the boatswain, carpenter, sailmaker, and
head steward; and the one on the port side with six,
for the two cooks and the four under stewards, all of
whom were men skilful and experienced in their several
departments. Forward of these was the kitchen,
from which opened the lamp room, a triangular closet
in the bow of the ship. Mr. Lowington had taken
the idea of locating the cooking apartment in the
extreme forward part of the vessel from the Victoria
and Albert, the steam yacht of the Queen of England.</p>

<p>The hold beneath the berth deck contained the water
tanks, bread room, chain lockers, and a multitude of
store rooms for provisions, clothing, and supplies of
every description needed on board during a long
voyage.</p>

<p>The Young America was to be officered and manned
by the students. They were to work the ship, to make
and take in sail, to reef, steer, and wash down decks,
as well as study and recite their lessons. They were
to go aloft, stand watch, man the capstan, pull the
boats; in short, to do everything required of seamen
on board a ship. Mr. Lowington was to lure them
into the belief, while they were hauling tacks and
sheets, halyards and braces, that they were not at
work, but at play. The labor required of them was
an essential element in the plan, by which the boys
were to obtain, the necessary physical exercise, and the
discipline they so much needed.</p>

<p>By the first of April the last of the students had
reported to the principal on board, and the professors,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
as the boys insisted upon calling them, had taken possession
of their state rooms. Though some of the
pupils had been on board nearly a month, the organization
of the ship had not been commenced; but
classes had been formed in some of the studies, by
the teachers, and the pupils recited every day. The
boatswain had instructed the boys in rowing, and some
temporary regulations had been adopted for the eating
and sleeping departments. But not a boy had been
allowed to go aloft, and nothing more than ordinary
school discipline had been attempted.</p>

<p>The boys, as boys always are, were impatient at this
delay. They wanted to be bounding over the ocean&mdash;to
be on their way to some foreign port. They were
anxious to work, to climb the rigging, and stand at
the wheel. As yet they knew very little of the purposes
of the principal, and had but a faint perception
of the life they were to lead in the Academy Ship.
It was understood that the officers were to be selected
for their merit, and that the ship, some time or other,
was to cross the ocean; but beyond this, all was darkness
and uncertainty.</p>

<p>"To-morrow will be the first day of April," said
George Wilton, as he walked the deck of the Young
America with Richard Carnes, a dignified young gentleman
of seventeen. "Mr. Lowington said we should
go to work on that day."</p>

<p>"If he said so, then of course we shall go to work,"
replied Carnes.</p>

<p>"I'm tired of waiting," added Wilton. "I think
this is a stupid kind of life. We are not even tied to
a bell rope here."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span></p>

<p>"You will get discipline enough as soon as the crew
are organized."</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall. Do you think we shall go to
sea to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Go to sea to-morrow!" exclaimed Carnes.</p>

<p>"Shuffles said so."</p>

<p>"How can we go to sea to-morrow? The crew
don't know the mainmast from a handspike. They
couldn't do anything with the ship now; they don't
know the ropes."</p>

<p>"You do, Carnes."</p>

<p>"Well, I know something about a ship," replied the
dignified young gentleman, who had made one voyage
up the Mediterranean with his uncle.</p>

<p>"I was pretty sure we should get out into blue
water by to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Shuffles said so."</p>

<p>"He is mistaken."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know? I'm content to wait till orders
come."</p>

<p>"I don't want to wait any longer," added Wilton.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, fellows?" asked
Shuffles, joining them, as they walked forward.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say we were going to sea to-morrow,
Shuffles?" asked Wilton.</p>

<p>"Of course we are."</p>

<p>"Who says so?" demanded Carnes.</p>

<p>"All the fellows say so."</p>

<p>"It can't be true."</p>

<p>"Why not? We are not going to stay here forever."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span></p>

<p>"In my opinion, we shall stay here some weeks, if
not some months," added Carnes.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To pursue our studies, in the first place, and to
learn our duty as seamen, in the second."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I shall stay here a great while
longer," said Shuffles, with evident disgust. "There's
no fun lying here."</p>

<p>"You can't help yourself," added Wilton.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can't, but I can try," said Shuffles, as
he glanced towards the shore.</p>

<p>"All hands ahoy!" shouted Peaks, the boatswain,
as his shrill whistle rang through the ship.</p>

<p>The boys had been taught the meaning of this call,
and they gathered in the waist, eager to know what
was to be required of them.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington stood on the raised hatch over the
main scuttle, where all the students could see him. It
was evident that he had some announcement to make,
especially as the following day had been assigned
for organizing the ship's company. The boys were
silent, and their faces betrayed the curiosity which
they felt.</p>

<p>"Young gentleman," the principal began, "this
ship will go into commission to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Don't know what you mean, sir," said Paul Kendall
as Mr. Lowington paused to observe the effect of
his announcement.</p>

<p>"I did not suppose that many of you would understand
the expression. In the navy, a ship is said to
go into commission when the captain takes his place
on board, and the crew are organized for duty. When
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
this takes place, the ensign is hoisted. To-morrow,
at twelve o'clock, we shall display the colors at the
peak. With us, going into commission will only mean
the organization of our school. From that time, we
shall observe the discipline of a man-of-war, so far as
the ship and crew are concerned."</p>

<p>"Shall we go to sea then?" asked Wilton.</p>

<p>"I think not," replied Mr. Lowington, laughing.
"We shall not leave the harbor till every officer and
seaman knows his duty. You shall have enough to
do to-morrow, young gentlemen."</p>

<p>"When shall we be able to go to sea?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. There are many ropes in the
ship, and you have a great deal to learn before I
shall be willing to trust you with the anchor at the
cat-head."</p>

<p>"What is the cat-head, sir?" asked Kendall</p>

<p>"Do you wish to go to sea without knowing what
the cat-head is?" replied the principal. "You shall
know in due time. To-morrow we shall select the
officers, fifteen in number, who are to occupy the after
cabin."</p>

<p>This announcement created a decided sensation
among the eighty-seven boys gathered in the waist,
for the subject had been full of interest to them. The
after cabin had thus far been a sealed book; the door
was locked, and they had not even seen the inside of
the apartment. They were curious to visit this cabin,
and to know who were to occupy it.</p>

<p>"After the organization of the school, it is my intention
to give these offices to those who obtain the highest
number of merit marks, which will be given for good
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
conduct, good lessons, and progress in seamanship.
The best boy, who is at the same time the best scholar
and the best seaman, shall be captain. We have no
marks now by which to make the selection, and I
intend to have you elect him the first time, reserving
to myself the right to veto your choice if it is obviously
an improper one."</p>

<p>As Mr. Lowington uttered this last remark, he
glanced, perhaps unconsciously, at Shuffles, who
stood directly in front of him.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, the ballot will take place to-morrow
morning, at nine o'clock. I have given you
this notice, that you may be able to consider the matter
and, if you choose, to make nominations for the
several offices," continued the principal.</p>

<p>"What are the offices, sir?"</p>

<p>"The first and most important one, of course, is the
captain. The others are four lieutenants, four masters,
two pursers, and four midshipmen."</p>

<p>"What are they to do?" asked Kendall.</p>

<p>"I will not explain their duties now; it would
require too much time. I mentioned them in the
order of their importance. Now, young gentlemen,
you should select your candidates for these offices by
merit, not by favor. I am aware that a few of you
have been to sea, but probably none of you are competent
to handle a ship; and your choice should be
based mainly on good character and good conduct.
I hope I shall be able to approve the choice you may
make. You are dismissed now."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the principal!" shouted one of
the boys.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span></p>

<p>"Silence, young gentleman! Let me say now, that
no expressions of approbation or disapprobation are to
be allowed."</p>

<p>The boys separated into groups, and immediately
gave their attention to the important subject suggested
to them by Mr. Lowington. It must be acknowledged
that violent symptoms of "log-rolling" began to be
exhibited. There were fifty, if not eighty-seven young
men who wished to be captain, and sit at the head of
the table in the after cabin. Some of them went
down into the steerage, and in five minutes there was
a confused jabbering in every part of the ship.</p>

<p>"For whom shall you vote, Wilton?" asked Shuffles
in a group of half a dozen which had gathered
around one of the mess tables.</p>

<p>"I don't know? whom do you go for?" replied
Wilton.</p>

<p>"I rather think I shall go for Bob Shuffles. In my
opinion, he is the best fellow on board," replied the
owner of that name.</p>

<p>"That's modest," laughed Wilton.</p>

<p>"Do you know of any fellow that would make a
better captain than I should?"</p>

<p>"You don't know the first thing about a ship."</p>

<p>"What odds does that make? I can learn as fast
as anybody else."</p>

<p>"Do you expect every fellow to vote for himself?"
asked Howe, another of the group.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't; I expect them to vote for me,"
answered Shuffles, with great good-nature.</p>

<p>"You are rather cheeky, Shuffles."</p>

<p>"What's the use of mincing the matter? Here we
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
are, half a dozen of the best fellows in the ship. We
can't all be captain; but one of us can be just as well
as not."</p>

<p>"That's so," added Howe, approvingly. "But who
shall that one be?"</p>

<p>"I am the one, without a doubt," said Shuffles.</p>

<p>"I don't see it," interposed Monroe, shaking his
head; and he was the young gentleman who had
assisted the aspirant for the captaincy to rob Mr.
Lowington's favorite peach tree.</p>

<p>"What have you got to say about it, Ike Monroe?
Do you expect us to go for you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say so."</p>

<p>"That's what you meant."</p>

<p>"I've just as much right to the place as you have,
Bob Shuffles."</p>

<p>"Do you think you could make the fellows stand
round as I can? But hold on; fellows, don't let us
fight about it. We are just the best six fellows
on board, and if we have a mind to do so, we
can have this thing all our own way," continued
Shuffles.</p>

<p>"I don't see how," said Philip Sanborn.</p>

<p>"Don't you know how the politicians manage these
things?"</p>

<p>"I don't."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, then."</p>

<p>"But the principal said we must go according to
merit, and elect the fellows who were the best fitted
for the offices," interposed Howe.</p>

<p>"Exactly so; that's just what we are going to do.
I'm going to be captain; can you tell me of any
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
better fellow for the place?" demanded Shuffles, who,
putting aside the jesting manner in which he had
commenced the discussion, now assumed an earnest
and impudent tone.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear what Lowington said when he
wound up his speech?" asked Wilton.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"About vetoing our choice if it was not a proper
one."</p>

<p>"What of it?" asked Shuffles, innocently.</p>

<p>"Don't you think he would veto you?"</p>

<p>"Me! Not he! Lowington knows that I'm smart;
I was too smart for him once, and he knows it. He
won't veto me. We have been the best of friends
lately."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he'll have a chance to veto you,"
said Wilton.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe you will be elected."</p>

<p>"I know I shall, if we manage it right. Let us
look at it," continued Shuffles, as he took a pencil
from his pocket. "Got a piece of paper?"</p>

<p>Monroe gave him a piece of paper, and the wire-puller
began to make his calculations.</p>

<p>"Eighty-seven votes," said he, writing the number
on the paper. "Necessary to a choice, forty-four.
Here are six votes to start with."</p>

<p>"For whom?" asked Monroe.</p>

<p>"For me, for captain, first, and for each of the
others for whatever place he wants; say for Wilton
for first lieutenant; Howe for second, Sanborn for
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
third, Monroe for fourth, and Adler for first master.
What do you say to that, fellows?"</p>

<p>As with the political "slate," there was some difference
of opinion in regard to the minor officers, even
after Shuffles' claim to the captaincy had been conceded
But this disposition of the spoils was finally
agreed to.</p>

<p>"Now we want thirty-eight more votes," Shuffles
proceeded.</p>

<p>"Just so; and you might as well attempt to jump
over the main royal yard as to get them," added Adler,
who, having been assigned to the office lowest in rank,
was least satisfied with the "slate."</p>

<p>"Hold on; we haven't done yet. There are nine
more offices. Now we will pick out some good fellow
that will work for us, for each of these places;
then we will promise him six votes if he will go our
ticket, and do what he can for us."</p>

<p>"That will give us only fifteen votes," said Adler.</p>

<p>"I think that will be doing very well to start with.
Then you five fellows can electioneer for me, and I'll
do the same for you."</p>

<p>"I think we have made one mistake," added Sanborn.
"Most of the fellows will go for Carnes for
captain. He is an old salt, and has more influence
than any other student in the ship. We ought to offer
him some place."</p>

<p>"Make him purser, if you like," said Shuffles, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"That won't go down. Make him first lieutenant."</p>

<p>"And shove me out?" demanded Wilton, indignantly.
"I don't see it!"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor I," added Shuffles. "I won't vote for Carnes,
any how. He's a snob and a flunky."</p>

<p>It was useless to resist the fiat of the chief wire-puller;
the ticket remained as it had been originally
prepared; and the young gentlemen proceeded to
distribute the rest of the offices.</p>

<h4>THE ENSIGN AT THE PEAK.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>The students on board of the Young America
were between the ages of fourteen and seventeen.
By the regulations, no boy under fourteen or
over seventeen could be admitted, and they averaged
about fifteen. They had, therefore, reached the years
of discretion. Among them were a great many who
were disposed to be wild boys, and not a few who
had found it difficult to remain in similar institutions
on shore. They were not criminal or depraved, but
simply wild; with a tendency to break through reasonable
restraint; with a taste for mad pranks, and a contempt
for authority.</p>

<p>Of this class, who were a trial and a torment to the
teachers of the ordinary high schools and academies,
the larger proportion would have scorned to steal, or
commit any wanton outrage upon the persons or property
of others. There were many high-minded, noble-hearted
young men, who could not tamely submit to
authority, and were prone to insubordination, and
who only needed the right kind of discipline to make
them earnest and faithful men and useful citizens.
There were few, if any, dunces or blockheads among
them, for a life on shipboard had no attractions for
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
such boys. They were, almost without an exception,
wide-awake, bold, daring fellows, who had a taste for
stirring events; fellows who wanted to climb the
Rocky Mountains, visit the North Pole, and explore
the Mammoth Cave. They were full of fun and mischief
and it would have been easy at any time to get
up a party among them to march the principal's cow
into the parlor of the Academy; to climb to the belfry
on a winter's night, and fill the inverted bell with
water, where it would freeze solid before morning; or
to convey the occupants of the hen-coop to the recitation
room.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Lowington's task to repress the mischief
in these boys, to keep them occupied with work and
play, and to develop their moral and mental capacities.
He had doubtless taken a heavy load upon himself
but he felt that he was to labor for his race and
his country. At least one half of his students were
too wild to attend the ordinary public or private
schools, or to profit by them if admitted. With such
material, his work could not be a sinecure. But he
had a taste for it, and he gave his whole heart and
soul to the performance of his duties.</p>

<p>When the students were gathered on board the
Young America, they were mostly strangers to him,
though he had communicated personally or by letter
with the parents of all of them. He had read and
listened to the stories of their pranks and peccadilloes,
but when they came together, he hardly knew one
from another, and was not prejudiced against any
individual by the terrible accounts of him related by
parents, guardians, or teachers. He purposed to give
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
them the opportunity to select their own officers at
first, in order to win a more cheerful obedience from
them, and because the students knew each other better
than he knew them.</p>

<p>After the announcement of the principal that the
voting would commence on the following morning,
nothing else was talked of on board. The qualifications
of various members of the school were discussed
by groups of excited voters; and we must do them
the justice to say that most of them considered the
matter unselfishly and with a single eye to the public
good. Perhaps it is a little remarkable that not a
single student, outside of the little group of wire-pullers
that gathered in the steerage, thought of Shuffles
for the position of captain; and the "log-rollers"
were likely to have up-hill work in electing themselves
to the six principal offices. But they went to work,
and labored very diligently till bed-time in carrying
their point.</p>

<p>While none thought of Shuffles in connection with
the highest position, many mentioned the dignified
young gentleman, who had made one voyage up the
Mediterranean&mdash;Richard Carnes. He had been on
board a fortnight, and had won and retained the respect
of all his companions.</p>

<p>Before the little band of wire-pullers in the steerage
had made up the "slate" to suit their minds, the
crowd on deck had agreed upon Richard Carnes for
captain, and were busy in discussing the qualifications
of others for the subordinate offices, when the
log-rollers separated, and went to work upon their
mission.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span></p>

<p>"How are you going to vote for captain, Kendall?"
said Wilton, stopping up to the young gentleman who
had proposed so many questions to the principal, and
who had been so honest in confessing his ignorance
of nautical matters.</p>

<p>"For Carnes, of course."</p>

<p>"Humph! I wouldn't vote for him," sneered the
wire-puller.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He's too stiff; he'll put on airs, and be a tyrant
over us."</p>

<p>"No, he won't."</p>

<p>"You see if he don't. I say, Kendall, are you up
for any office?" continued Wilton, with a certain appearance
of slyness which the straightforward young
gentleman did not exactly like.</p>

<p>"Am I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you. Wouldn't you like a room in the after
cabin?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I would," answered Kendall, thoughtfully;
and the place was certainly very inviting to
him.</p>

<p>"They say the after cabin is a perfect little palace."</p>

<p>"I dare say it is."</p>

<p>"You can just as well go in there, if you like."</p>

<p>"I don't see how that can be. I don't think I'm fit
to be an officer. I am from Cincinnati, and I never
saw a ship till I came east three weeks ago."</p>

<p>"None of the fellows know anything about a ship.
All of us will have to learn."</p>

<p>"Carnes knows all about one."</p>

<p>"No, he don't. He made one voyage, and knows
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
just enough to talk salt. He's a good fellow enough,
but he isn't fit for captain. If you want to be an
officer, Kendall, and have a berth in the after cabin,
you can, just as well as not."</p>

<p>"Well, I would like such a place; I can't deny it;
but I don't think the fellows will go for me."</p>

<p>"They will, if you say so."</p>

<p>"If I say so! I'm not going to ask them to vote
for me," replied Kendall, warmly; for he was no politician
and had a vein of modesty in his composition.</p>

<p>"You needn't say a word to any one. If you will
go for our ticket, it will be all right. Half a dozen of
us have talked this matter over, and we have concluded
that you would be the best fellow for second master."</p>

<p>"Have you?" asked Kendall, who could not help
being gratified to learn that even half a dozen of his
companions had thought him worthy to be an officer
of so high a rank as second master. "I'm very much
obliged to you."</p>

<p>"All you have to do, is to go for our ticket."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by your ticket?" demanded
Kendall, who was rather confused by the technical
terms of the wire-puller.</p>

<p>Wilton explained that his little party had selected a
candidate for each of the offices; and if all the fellows
agreed to it, there would be fifteen votes for their ticket,
to begin with.</p>

<p>"Well, what is your ticket?" demanded Kendall,
impatiently. "If they are all good fellows, I will go
for them. Of course you mean to vote for Carnes for
captain."</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied Wilton, with evident dis
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>gust.
"We shall put up a better fellow than he is for
captain."</p>

<p>"Why, all the boys are going for him," added Kendall,
astonished to find there were any who did not
believe in Carnes.</p>

<p>"No, they are not."</p>

<p>"I thought they were."</p>

<p>"He will not be elected, and you need not throw
your vote away upon him, because, if you don't want
a place in the after cabin, there are plenty of fellows
who do," added the wire-puller, with apparent indifference.</p>

<p>"But I do want it."</p>

<p>"Then all you have to do, is to go for our ticket."</p>

<p>"I think Carnes will make the best captain."</p>

<p>"Very well; if you think so, you have a right to
your own opinion. I haven't any mortgage on it."</p>

<p>"Whom are you going to run for captain?"</p>

<p>"It's no use to talk any more about it, if you are
going for Carnes," replied Wilton, as he turned to
move away.</p>

<p>The wire-puller was playing a part. Paul Kendall
was a noble little fellow, and was already a great
favorite on board, not only with the boys, but with
the principal and the professors. Wilton knew that
he had a great deal of influence, and it was important
to secure him for their ticket. If he could tell others
that Kendall was going for their men, it would induce
many to join their party. The "favorite," though he
was an honest, noble-hearted fellow, was still human,
and a berth in the after cabin was a strong temptation
to him.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not going to say I'll vote for a fellow till I
know who he is," added Kendall. "If he's the right
person, perhaps I'll go for him, though I wanted to
see Carnes captain."</p>

<p>"Carnes can't be elected, I tell you. We are going
against him."</p>

<p>"Whom are you going for, then?"</p>

<p>"For Bob Shuffles," replied Wilton, desperately,
for he did not wish to mention his candidate till he
had won the assent of his companion.</p>

<p>"Shuffles!" exclaimed Kendall, with something
like horror mingled with his astonishment; "I shall
not go for him, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he is the right person for the place."</p>

<p>"I do; he's a first-rate fellow&mdash;none of your milk
and water chaps, that swallow camels and strain at
gnats."</p>

<p>Kendall had some decided objections to Shuffles,
and he positively refused to vote for him, even to obtain
the coveted position in the after cabin. Wilton
argued the matter with much skill and cunning; but
his logic and his eloquence were both wasted.</p>

<p>"Well, if you won't go for Shuffles, you must be
content with your place in the steerage," added Wilton.</p>

<p>"I won't go for him, any how," said Kendall,
firmly.</p>

<p>"You are making a mistake."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. I'm bound to vote for the best
fellow, and I'm sure Shuffles isn't the right one."</p>

<p>"See here, Kendall; don't say a word to the others
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
that I spoke to you of this little matter. I thought you
would go with us, or I shouldn't have said anything
to you."</p>

<p>"Not say anything? Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it will be better to keep still."</p>

<p>"I shall not do anything of the kind. You have
got up a plan to defeat Carnes, by giving the offices to
fellows who will vote against him. You wish me to
keep still, while you carry out your plan. I can see
through a cord of wood, when there's a hole big
enough."</p>

<p>"I mentioned this thing to you in confidence."</p>

<p>"You didn't say a word about confidence; and I
didn't promise to keep still. I won't keep still. I
think it is a mean trick to buy up the votes of the
fellows, and I'll blow the whole thing higher than a
kite."</p>

<p>"You'll catch it if you do," said Wilton, in a
threatening tone.</p>

<p>"Catch what?" demanded Kendall, with a very
pretty exhibition of dignity.</p>

<p>"Bob Shuffles will give it to you."</p>

<p>"Give what to me?"</p>

<p>"Give you the biggest licking you ever had in your
life," answered Wilton, angrily, "You are so stupid,
you can't understand anything."</p>

<p>"I think I can understand the licking, when if
comes. That's a game that two can play at."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you little bantam? Do you
think you can whip Bob Shuffles?"</p>

<p>"I had no idea of whipping him; and I have no
idea of his whipping me, either."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span></p>

<p>Kendall was spunky. Wilton could make nothing
of him by threats or persuasion; and he turned away
from him to seek a more promising field of labor.
Kendall took off his cap, scratched his head as he
reflected upon the event which had just transpired,
and made up his mind that it was an insult to an independent
elector to attempt to buy his vote with the
paltry consideration of an office. He was sorry that
he had been even tempted by the proposition of the
wire-pullers, and thankful that his sense of honor and
decency had prompted him to decline it when asked to
vote for an improper person. True to his promise,
he made all haste to expose the conspiracy, as he
regarded it, against Carnes.</p>

<p>When the students turned in that night, the wire-pullers
had found a sufficient number of candidates
for all the offices on the terms set forth in the compact,
each of whom had promised to use his influence for
the entire ticket. Shuffles had made a very pretty
calculation, to the effect that each of the fifteen candidates
could influence at least two votes besides his own
for the ticket, which would inevitably elect it. But
during all this time Paul Kendall had been laboring
like a Trojan for Carnes, and had induced his friends
to do the same.</p>

<p>At nine-o'clock in the morning, the polls were
opened for the election of officers. A box was placed
on the fife-rail, at the mainmast, in which the ballots
were deposited, under the inspection of Professor
Mapps.</p>

<p>"Have all the students voted?" called the professor,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
when the voting was suspended. "If so, I declare
the poll closed."</p>

<p>It was a moment of intense excitement on the spar
deck of the Young America when Mr. Lowington
stood up on the hatch to announce the vote. There
was a pleasant smile upon his face, which indicated
that it would not be his painful duty to veto the choice
of the independent electors.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, your balloting appears to have
been conducted with entire fairness," said he, "and I
will proceed to declare the result. Whole number of
votes, eighty-seven; necessary to a choice, forty-four.
Paul Kendall has five; Charles Gordon has seven;
Robert Shuffles has twenty-two; Richard Carnes
has fifty-three, and is elected captain of the Young
America for the succeeding three months."</p>

<p>The party who had worked and voted for Carnes
applauded the result most lustily, and gave three
cheers for the new captain, which, on this exciting
occasion, were not objected to by the principal. Shuffles's
jaw dropped down, and his lip quivered with
angry emotion.</p>

<p>"That little whipper-snapper of a Kendall did that,"
said Wilton, in a low tone, to the disappointed candidate.
"I was afraid of this when I saw him blowing
about the deck."</p>

<p>"I'll settle it with him when I get a good chance,"
growled Shuffles, as he went to the rail and looked
over into the water, in order to conceal his disappointment
and chagrin.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen will bring in their votes for first
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
lieutenant," said Professor Mapps, as he placed the
box on the fife-rail again.</p>

<p>The boys marched around the mainmast, and deposited
their ballots for the second officer, as they had
done before. The friends of Shuffles rallied again,
hoping that something might yet come of the compact
they had made with him, and gave him their votes for
first lieutenant, though, in his chagrin, he declared that
he would not accept the position. Fortunately for him,
he was not called upon to do so; for Charles Gordon
was elected by a very large majority. As the election
proceeded, it became evident that there was no office
for Shuffles. Paul Kendall was elected fourth lieutenant
and the announcement of the vote was greeted
by even more hearty applause than had been bestowed
upon the captain.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the balloting, Shuffles found
that not a single one of the wire-pullers, or of the
candidates nominated by them, had been elected.
The attempt to bribe the independent voters, by giving
them office, had been a signal failure; and it is to
be hoped that Young America, when fully developed,
will stick to his principles.</p>

<p>"Captain Richard Carnes," said Mr. Lowington, as
he stepped upon the hatch, after the voting had been
concluded.</p>

<p>The young gentleman thus addressed came forward,
blushing beneath the honors which had been bestowed
upon him. The principal took his hand.</p>

<p>"Captain Carnes, I congratulate you upon your
election to the highest office in the gift of your com
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>panions;
and I congratulate your fellow-students also
upon having so good a young man to handle the ship.
You have been modest, and they have been wise. I
congratulate you both. Young gentlemen, I am
satisfied that your captain will be just, courteous, and
gentlemanly, in his relations with you; and I hope
you will yield a willing and cheerful obedience to his
orders, and to those of all your superiors. Let me
say that this business is not a farce; it is not mere
boys' play; for as soon as the officers and crew are
fully trained and instructed, all ship duty will be
carried on without assistance from me or others.
When necessary, I shall advise the captain what to
do, but I shall not do it myself; neither shall I needlessly
interfere with the discipline of the ship.</p>

<p>"This is the last time an election of officers will be
permitted, for it is liable to many objections, not the
least of which are the bribery and corruption by which
some have attempted to obtain office."</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington looked at Shuffles, as though he
knew all about the method to which he had resorted
to secure an election; but we are quite sure that Paul
Kendall had never lisped a word of it to him, or to
any of the instructors.</p>

<p>"On the first day of July, young gentlemen, all
the offices will be vacant; and they will be awarded
strictly in accordance with the marks you may obtain.
There will be no veto upon the result of the merit
roll. These places, therefore, are open to all. We
have no aristocracy on board. Every student in the
ship is a candidate for the captaincy. Now, if the
officers elect will follow me to the after cabin, I will
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
install them into their new positions; after which I
will proceed to organize the crew."</p>

<p>The door of the after cabin, which had hitherto
been a mystery to all the boys, was unlocked by the
head steward, and Mr. Lowington, followed by the
officers, entered. The students on deck were ordered
forward, and were not even permitted to look down
the companion-way, for the principal intended to keep
the after cabin exclusively for the officers; and no one
not entitled to admission was to be allowed to cross
its threshold. He believed that this mystery, and this
rigid adherence to the division line between officers
and crew, would promote the discipline of the ship,
and enhance the value of the offices&mdash;the prizes for
good conduct, and general fidelity to duty.</p>

<p>"Captain Carnes, this is your state room," continued
Mr. Lowington, opening the door of the room
farthest forward on the starboard side. "As the commander
of the ship you are entitled to an apartment
by yourself."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied the captain, as he stepped
into the room.</p>

<p>"You will find on the hooks your uniform as
captain. There are three suits, from which you will
select one that fits you."</p>

<p>Captain Carnes entered and closed the door. If he
did not feel like a king, he ought to have felt so.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington then gave the next room to the first
and second lieutenants, who were to occupy it together;
and they were also directed to clothe themselves in the
uniforms deposited there for their use. The third state
room was given to the third and fourth lieutenants, and
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
the fourth to the first and second midshipmen. The
forward room of the port side was assigned to the first
and second masters; the next to the third and fourth;
the third to the two pursers, and the last to the third
and fourth midshipmen.</p>

<p>In a short time the officers came out of their rooms
clothed in their uniforms, which consisted of a blue
frock coat, with brass buttons, and blue pants. The
cap was of the same material, with a gold band
around it. Thus far the uniforms were all alike;
but there were distinguishing insignia to indicate the
rank of each. All the officers had shoulder-straps, by
which their positions were designated. The captain
had two anchors; the first lieutenant had one anchor,
with four stars, one above, one below, and one on
each side; the second lieutenant had the anchor with
three stars&mdash;none above; the third lieutenant, one
star on each side of the anchor; and the fourth lieutenant
one star below the anchor. The captain also
wore five narrow gold bands on each of his coat
sleeves; the first lieutenant four, and so on, the
fourth wearing but one band.</p>

<p>The shoulder-straps of the masters contained no
anchor; only the stars, one for each grade, the first
master having four stars; the fourth only one. The
rank of the pursers was indicated by the outline of a
parallelogram for the second, and two of the same
figure, one within the other, for the first. The straps
of the midshipmen contained gilt numbers, from one
to four, designating their grade.</p>

<p>The officers presented a very elegant and dashing
appearance in their new uniform; and if some of them
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
did not feel a little vain, it was because they were less
human than boys usually are.</p>

<p>"What are we to do, sir?" asked Kendall of the
principal, after the uniforms had been duly criticised.</p>

<p>"Nothing, at present."</p>

<p>"Nothing! Why, I feel like a counterfeit gold
dollar, in this rig, when I know no more about a
ship than I do about the inside of the moon."</p>

<p>"You will learn in due time. You will go on deck
now, young gentlemen; and remember that, as officers,
you are not to be familiar with the crew while you are
on duty."</p>

<p>"Can't we speak to them?" asked Kendall, who
was not disposed to be so exclusive as naval discipline
required him to be.</p>

<p>"Not while you are on duty, except when it is
necessary to do so. We will now assign the berths
in the steerage to the crew."</p>

<p>As the boys came on board, they had taken the
berths as they pleased. Shuffles had selected a room,
and invited his "cronies" to occupy the bunks it contained
with him. The berths were now to be distributed
by lot. Professor Mapps had provided seventy-two
slips of paper, on each of which he had written
a number. The boys were mustered into line, and
drew out these numbers from the package. As each
student drew his slip, the purser wrote down his name
in a book, with the number he had drawn.</p>

<p>In the steerage, each berth had its own number,
which was also applied to a locker, and a seat at one
of the mess tables. When the drawing was completed
each student had his berth, his clothes locker,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
and his seat at meals. Many of them were extremely
dissatisfied when they found that they had been separated
from their "cronies;" but the principal was firm,
and would not allow a single change to be made.</p>

<p>By this time it was twelve o'clock, and Boatswain
Peaks piped all hands to muster. The ensign was
hoisted, and saluted with three cheers, in which all
hands, young and old, joined. When this ceremony
was finished, the crew were piped to dinner, and the
officers went to their cabin, where the steward had set
the table for them for the first time. They dined like
lords, though upon the same fare as their companions
in the steerage.</p>

<h4>OFFICERS AND SEAMEN.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>After dinner the organization of the crew was
continued. All hands were "piped to muster,"
and by this time most of those who had been disaffected
at the drawing of berths had recovered their
natural equanimity, and all were intensely interested
in the arrangement of the details. None of the boys
knew what was coming, and their curiosity kept them
in a continuous state of excitement.</p>

<p>"All who have drawn even numbers will take the
starboard side of the ship," said Mr. Lowington from
his perch on the hatch. "All who have drawn odd
numbers will take the port side."</p>

<p>"This is the starboard side, my lads," added Mr.
Fluxion, the instructor in mathematics&mdash;who, like the
principal, had been a naval officer,&mdash;as he pointed to
the right, looking forward.</p>

<p>Some had already forgotten their numbers, and there
was considerable confusion before the order could be
obeyed.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, the books will be opened to-day;
and a student who forgets his number again will
lose a mark," said Mr. Lowington. "Are they all in
their places, Mr. Fluxion?"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span></p>

<p>"They are, sir," replied the instructor, who had
just counted them.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, you are thus divided into two
equal parts&mdash;the starboard and the port watches.
Now form a straight line, toe the crack, and call your
numbers in order, beginning with the starboard watch."</p>

<p>The boys eagerly followed this direction, though
some assistance was required from the instructors in
repressing their superfluous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Very well," continued Mr. Lowington, when the
students were formed in two lines. "Every boy in
the starboard watch whose number is divisible by four,
step forward one pace. Number three in the port
watch, do the same. Mr. Mapps, oblige me by seeing
that every alternate boy in the line steps forward."</p>

<p>"The line is formed, sir," replied the instructor,
when he had carried out the direction of the principal.</p>

<p>"Each watch is now divided into two parts&mdash;the
first and second parts, as they will be called. Now,
young gentlemen, the clothing will be distributed, and
each student will put on his uniform at once."</p>

<p>The four lines were then marched down into the
steerage, each under the charge of an instructor, to a
particular locality, where the head steward and his
assistants had deposited the clothing for each watch
and quarter watch. The uniform consisted of blue
seaman's pants and a heavy flannel shirt or frock, such
as is worn in the United States navy. To each student
the following articles were served out:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2.5em;">
1 pea-jacket.<br />
1 blue cloth jacket.<br />
1 pair blue cloth pants.<br />
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
1 pair blue satinet pants.<br />
1 blue cap.<br />
1 straw hat, of coarse, sewed straw.<br />
1 Panama hat, bound.<br />
2 knit woollen shirts.<br />
2 pair knit woollen drawers.<br />
2 white frocks.<br />
2 pair white duck pants.<br />
4 pair socks.<br />
2 pair shoes.<br />
2 black silk neck-handkerchiefs.<br />
</p>

<p>These articles were given to the boys, and they were
required to put on the every-day uniform; after which
they were directed to arrange the rest of the clothing
in the lockers belonging to them. The contractor who
had furnished the goods was present with four tailors,
to attend to the fitting of the clothes, which were all
numbered according to the size. In a short time the
students began to come out of their rooms, clothed in
their new rig. They looked intensely "salt," and there
was no end to the jokes and smart things that were
said on this interesting occasion. Even Shuffles hardly
knew himself in his new dress.</p>

<p>The frock had a broad rolling collar, in each corner
of which was worked an anchor in white. The black
silk neck-handkerchief was worn under the collar, and
not many of the boys had acquired the art of tying the
regular sailor's knot. Boatswain Peaks not only stood
up as a model for them, but he adjusted the "neck
gear" for many of them. Bitts, the carpenter, and
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
Leech, the sailmaker, who were also old sailors, cheerfully
rendered a valet's assistance to such as needed
help.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the directions of Mr. Lowington, the
shore suits of the students were done up in bundles,
each marked with the owner's name, and the head
steward took them to Mr. Lowington's house for
storage.</p>

<p>Rigged out in their "sea togs," the students began
to feel salt, as well as to look salt. Some of them tried
to imitate the rolling gait of the boatswain when they
walked, and some of them began to exhibit an alarming
tendency to indulge in sea slang.</p>

<p>"There, my hearty, you look like a sailor now,"
said Peaks, when he had rolled over the collar and
tied the square knot in the handkerchief of Wilton.</p>

<p>"Shiver my timbers, but I feel like one," laughed
the embryo seaman.</p>

<p>"What's that, young gentleman?" demanded Mr.
Lowington, who happened to be within hearing;
"what did you say?"</p>

<p>"I said I felt like a sailor, sir."</p>

<p>"What was the expression you used?"</p>

<p>"I only said shiver my timbers, sir."</p>

<p>"You stole that expression from a yellow-covered
novel. Did you ever hear Mr. Peaks, who has been a
sailor all his lifetime, use such language?"</p>

<p>"I'll be bound he never did," added Peaks.</p>

<p>"No, sir. I don't know that I ever did."</p>

<p>"Some sailors do use such expressions; but it is
gross affectation for these young gentlemen, who never
saw a blue wave, to indulge in them. If you please,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
Wilton, you will not use such language. It is simply
ridiculous. Mr. Peaks, you will pipe all hands to
muster again."</p>

<p>The shrill whistle of the boatswain sounded through
the ship, and the boys tumbled up the ladders, eager
to learn what was to be done next. As they formed
in lines, they presented a novel and picturesque appearance
in their jaunty uniform. Most of them had
already learned to wear their caps canted over on one
side, and not a few of them, perhaps as much from
necessity as because it was a sailor's habit, hitched up
their trousers, and thrust their hands deep down into
the side pockets.</p>

<p>The students were again formed in watches and
quarter watches, each of which classes and sub-classes
was indicated on the uniforms. All the starboard
watch wore a small silver star on the right arm, above
the elbow, and the port watch the same emblem on
the left arm. The first part of each watch had a
figure 1, under the star, and the second part a figure
2 in the same position.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent in the organization
for ship's duty, which was far from completed when
the sun went down. The next day every boy was
kept so busy that he had no time to grumble. The
instructors attended to the lessons in the steerage with
one watch, while the other was on deck acquiring seamanship.
In the course of the month, as the boys
learned their duties, and the capabilities of each were
ascertained, they were assigned to their stations in the
various evolutions required in working the vessel.</p>

<p>Boatswain Peaks had taught the boys, a few at a
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
time, how to set a sail, reef and furl it. They had
been gradually accustomed to going aloft, until the
giddy height of the main royal did not appall them,
and they could lay out on the yards without thinking
of the empty space beneath them. By the first of
June, all the petty officers had been appointed, and
every student had his station billet. When the order
was given to unmoor ship, to make sail, or to furl the
sails, every one knew where to go and what to do.
The station billets were cards on which the various
evolutions of the ship had been printed in a column
on the left, while the particular duty of the owner of
the card was written against it. The card was kept
by the student, and he was expected to learn its contents
so that he could take his place without stopping
to consult it, when an order was given. Here is a
specimen of the cards:&mdash;</p>

<p>The crew had been in training a month before an
attempt was made to set more than one sail at once;
but by this time the officers knew the orders, having
practised every day since the organization. The
petty officers had been appointed, and had, to some
extent, become familiar with their duties.</p>

<p>The boys still continued to wonder when the Young
America would go on a cruise, for they were very
anxious to see the blue water, and to roll on the great
waves of the Atlantic; but they were so constantly
occupied with ship's duty and their studies, that the
time did not hang heavily on their hands. Two
months of constant practice had made tolerable seamen
of them, and the discipline of the ship went on
regularly. The young officers, as Mr. Lowington had
promised, began to conduct the evolutions and give
the orders.</p>

<p>On the 1st day of June, after breakfast, the students
were thrown into a fever of excitement by an unusual
order, and they ventured to hope that the ship was to
leave her moorings.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gordon, you will pipe all hands to muster,"
said Captain Carnes to the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Pass the word for the boatswain," added Gordon
to one of the midshipmen, who stood near him.</p>

<p>This call was answered, not by Peaks, who no
longer performed the duties of boatswain, but by one
of the students, who had been appointed to this position.</p>

<p>"Pipe all hands to muster, boatswain," said the
first lieutenant, as the petty officer touched his cap to
him.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span></p>

<p>"All hands on deck, ahoy!" shouted the boatswain,
as he piped the call.</p>

<p>This was an unusual order for that time of day, the
forenoon being appropriated to study for each watch
in turn; and those who were below hastened on deck
to ascertain what was to be done.</p>

<p>"All hands, stations for loosing sail!" piped the
boatswain, when ordered to do so by Gordon.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant was in charge of the ship, under
the direction of the captain. The second lieutenant
stood on the forecastle, where he was attended by the
boatswain. The third lieutenant was in the waist,
and the fourth on the quarter deck, near the mizzenmast.
These were the stations of the officers whenever
all hands were called. Mr. Lowington and the
instructors stood near the companion-way, watching
with interest this first attempt to make sail all over
the ship.</p>

<p>"Lay aloft, sail-loosers!" shouted Gordon; and his
order was repeated by the officers at their several
stations.</p>

<p>The little tars who belonged on the topsail and top-gallant
yards sprang up the rigging like so many cats,
excited beyond measure by the scene of activity around
them.</p>

<p>"Lower yardmen in the chains!" continued Gordon
and his order was passed, along by the officers.
"Aloft, lower yardmen!"</p>

<p>In a moment the crew were in their places; the
studding-sail booms were triced up with the usual
system, so that the sails could be reached.</p>

<p>"Lay out!" continued the first lieutenant; and the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
boys walked out on the foot-ropes to their stations on
the yards. "Loose!"</p>

<p>The ropes by which the sails were secured to the
yards were removed at this order, and the topmen held
the sails in their places.</p>

<p>"All ready on the forecastle, sir," reported Foster,
who was captain of that part of the ship.</p>

<p>"All ready in the foretop."</p>

<p>"All ready in the maintop."</p>

<p>"All ready in the mizzentop," reported the several
captains of the tops, in their proper order.</p>

<p>These reports were passed to the first lieutenant in
charge of the deck, by his subordinates.</p>

<p>"Let fall!" shouted Gordon, highly excited; and
the sails dropped from the yard. "Overhaul your
rigging aloft! Man sheets and halyards! Sheets
home, and hoist away!"</p>

<p>These orders were passed from mouth to mouth
among the officers, and return reports made, according
to the strict discipline of the navy. They were
promptly executed by the crew, though of course not
without some blunders; and the Young America was
covered with her cloud of canvas. Mr. Lowington
commended the officers and crew for the promptness
and skill they had displayed in their first concerted
attempt at making sail. He then directed Captain
Carnes to furl. Both evolutions were then repeated,
until a proficiency satisfactory for one day was attained.</p>

<p>"Not going to sea, after all," said Shuffles, when
the crew were dismissed from muster.</p>

<p>"No," replied Wilton. "I'm tired of lying here,
and if we don't go to sea soon, I shall take myself off."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm with you."</p>

<p>"I thought we were going to have some fun on
board, but we don't do anything but study and shake
out topsails."</p>

<p>"Do you know how you stand on marks, Wilton?"
asked Shuffles.</p>

<p>"No; not very high, though."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you shall get into the cabin
next term?"</p>

<p>"I know I shall not. I haven't tried for anything."</p>

<p>"On the first of next month, you know, new officers
will be appointed, and I suppose the crew will be
messed over again."</p>

<p>"I don't care, I'm getting tired of this thing, I
had a better time at the Academy before we came on
board."</p>

<p>"There isn't much chance for any sport. Hardly a
fellow has been allowed to go on shore since we
joined the ship."</p>

<p>"Well get up a mutiny, if things don't improve."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of that very thing myself," said
Shuffles, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"A mutiny!" exclaimed Wilton, who had used the
word in jest.</p>

<p>"Just for fum, you know," laughed Shuffles.</p>

<p>"You don't mean any such thing?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, of course."</p>

<p>"Do you at any time?"</p>

<p>"We want something more exciting than this kind
of a life. Here we are, kept down and treated like
common sailors. We have to touch our caps and
make our manners to Dick Carnes and the rest of the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
flunkies in the after cabin. My father pays as much
for me as Dick Carnes' father does for him, and I don't
think it is fair that he should live in the cabin and I in
the steerage."</p>

<p>"If you get marks enough, you can have a berth in
the cabin," replied Wilton.</p>

<p>"Marks! Confound the marks! I'm not a baby.
Do you think a fellow seventeen years old is going to
be put up or put down by marks?" said Shuffles.</p>

<p>"I thought you had been working for a place in
the cabin."</p>

<p>"So I have, but I don't expect to get it. I never
studied so hard in my life, and I believe I haven't had
a bad mark since I came on board, Lowington
thinks I have reformed," laughed Shuffles. "And
so I have."</p>

<p>"What do you want to get up a mutiny for, then?"</p>

<p>"I shall not, if I get a decent position; if I don't,
I'm going in for some fun."</p>

<p>"But do you really think of getting up a mutiny?"
asked Wilton, curiously.</p>

<p>"I was thinking the other day what a fine thing it
would be if our fellows had the ship all to themselves."</p>

<p>"What could we do with her?"</p>

<p>"Go on a cruise in her."</p>

<p>"We couldn't handle her; there is hardly a fellow
on board that knows anything about navigation."</p>

<p>"Of course, I don't mean to do anything yet a while;
not this year, perhaps. One of these days, if we stay
on board, we shall know all about a ship. Fifteen or
twenty of the fellows are studying navigation. We
are going to Europe some time or other. When
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
we do, we can take the ship, and go it on our own
hook."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you mean anything of the kind,
Bob Shuffles."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about it, anyhow. We can
lock Lowington and the rest of the old folks into their
cabin while they are at dinner; and there are enough
of us to handle Peaks and Bitts."</p>

<p>"I think you are crazy, Shuffles."</p>

<p>"We should have a high old time if we could get
possession of the ship. We wont say a word about
it yet."</p>

<p>"I think you had better not."</p>

<p>"We might go round Cape Horn into the Pacific,
and have a splendid time among the beautiful islands
of the South Sea."</p>

<p>"Of course all the fellows wouldn't join you."</p>

<p>"We could put those ashore somewhere who did
not agree with us."</p>

<p>"You know the penalty of mutiny on the high
seas."</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Shuffles, contemptuously. "It would
be nothing but it lark. No one would think of
hanging us, or even sending us to prison for it. My
father is rich enough to get me out of any scrape."</p>

<p>"So is mine; but I don't think it would be quite
safe to go into a mutiny."</p>

<p>"Not yet, my dear fellow. You can think it over."</p>

<p>"But I'm tired of this kind of a life. I liked it
first rate in the beginning. Do you think Lowington
really intends to go to sea with the ship?"</p>

<p>"I know he does."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span></p>

<p>"If he don't go pretty soon, I shall run away, and
go to sea in earnest."</p>

<p>"Don't say a word about the mutiny at present,
Wilton. By and by, if things go right, or if they
don't go right, we may want to take some stock in
such an enterprise."</p>

<p>"I don't see it yet, but of course I shall keep still."</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether even so daring a young man
as Shuffles, who had the temerity to do almost anything,
seriously contemplated getting up a mutiny.
Very likely his untamed and vicious imagination had
revelled in such an enterprise; had pictured the delights
of the rover's life at sea; but a boy of ordinary common
sense could hardly think of engaging in such a
mad scheme.</p>

<p>The last week of June, with which month ended the
first school term on board of the Young America,
was devoted to examinations and reviews in all the
studies for which extra marks were given. On the
last day the instructors made up the merit lists, and
on the morning of the 1st of July all hands were
mustered, and the result declared. Most of the officers,
all of whom had studied with unremitting diligence
in order to retain their positions, were reinstated
in their offices. The third lieutenant, however, fell
out, having failed in his reviews, and to the astonishment
of all, Robert Shuffles was found to be entitled
to the place. The first and second lieutenants exchanged
ranks, and Paul Kendall fell to the position
of second master. Three of the tenants of the after
cabin were compelled to move into the steerage, and
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
three of the crew were transferred to the officers'
quarters.</p>

<p>Many were disappointed, and perhaps some were
disheartened, for the competition had been a severe
struggle; and as much depended upon natural ability
as upon energy and perseverance. But the Young
America was a world by herself. She had all the
elements of society within her wooden walls, and
success and failure there followed the same rules as
in the great world of which she was an epitome.</p>

<p>After the officers had been duly installed in their
positions, the petty offices were given to those having
the highest number of marks among the crew. It
was certainly democratic for the late third lieutenant
to become captain of the foretop, and for a second
master to become coxswain of the professors' barge;
but these young gentlemen, though disappointed, submitted
with a good grace to their misfortune.</p>

<p>The student having the highest number of marks
among the crew was allowed to have the first choice
of berths in the steerage; the one having the next
highest number had the second choice, and so on,
until all the numbers had been appropriated. At the
conclusion of the reorganization, Mr. Lowington made
a speech, "comforting the mourners," and reminding
all the students that, on the 1st of October, there
would be another distribution of the places of honor.
He hoped those who had failed to attain what they
aspired to reach would not be discouraged, for, after
all, they had been gaining knowledge, and thus the
real end of the school had been reached.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span></p>

<p>"How about the mutiny?" said Wilton to the new
third lieutenant, when both were off duty in the
evening.</p>

<p>"It won't pay just now," replied Shuffles, with
great good humor.</p>

<p>"I suppose not," sneered Wilton, who had not
even won a petty office. "What would Lowington
say if he knew the third lieutenant talked of getting
up a mutiny on board?"</p>

<p>"What would he say?" repeated Shuffles, who was
as much surprised at the high rank he had gained as
his companion had been.</p>

<p>"Yes; what would he say if I should tell him
of it?"</p>

<p>"He would say you were a mean pup for telling
tales out of school; at least, he ought to say so, and I
think he would. Lowington is a pretty good fellow,
after all."</p>

<p>"No doubt he is, now you are third lieutenant."</p>

<p>"You needn't snuff at it, Wilton. If you want a
place, why don't you sail in, and get one. Just look
out for your marks; that's all you have to do."</p>

<p>"Marks! I thought a fellow seventeen years old
was not to be put up or put down by marks," said
Wilton, bitterly.</p>

<p>"That depends somewhat upon whether you get in
or out," laughed Shuffles.</p>

<p>"I suppose you and Paul Kendall will be fast
friends now," added the discontented student.</p>

<p>"Kendall behaves very well, and has treated me first
rate since I went into the cabin."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose if I want to run away, you will stop me
now."</p>

<p>"If you are going to do that, you musn't tell me of
it, now I'm an officer," replied Shuffles, as he turned
on his heel, and walked aft.</p>

<p>Wilton was disgusted, and felt that he had lost his
best friend, now that Shuffles had worked his way
into the cabin.</p>

Contents</a></p>


<p>"I would like leave of absence for to-morrow, Mr.
Pelham," said Wilton, as he touched his cap to
the first lieutenant of the Young America, on the day
before the Fourth of July.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to inform you, Wilton, that no leave
of absence will be granted to-morrow," replied Pelham
in accordance with the instructions given him
by the captain, who, in turn, had received his orders
from the principal.</p>

<p>"No leave!" exclaimed Wilton, his jaw dropping
down.</p>

<p>"Such are the orders."</p>

<p>"I have always been in the habit of celebrating the
Fourth of July," replied Wilton. "Are we to stay
on board the ship, and mope all day?"</p>

<p>"I presume the day will be celebrated on board in
a proper manner," added the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"On board! What can a fellow do here? We
might as well go to bed, and sleep off the day."</p>

<p>"No words are necessary, Wilton," replied Pelham
as he turned and walked away.</p>

<p>"That's a good one!" added Wilton, to the group
of boys who had come with him to the mainmast, to
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
request the same favor, if the spokesman was permitted
to go on shore and celebrate the day.</p>

<p>"Not to celebrate!" exclaimed Monroe, with something
like horror in his tones and looks.</p>

<p>"Work on the Fourth of July!" chimed in Adler.</p>

<p>"I won't stand it, for one!" said Wilton.</p>

<p>"Nor I, for another," added Monroe.</p>

<p>So said half a dozen others.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?" demanded
Adler. "Here we are, and we can't get
ashore."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can," said Wilton, as he led the way
to a retired part of the deck, where they could talk
without being overheard. "Did any one ever hear
of such a thing as keeping the fellows on board on the
Fourth of July? Why, every little Greek in the city
yonder has his liberty on that day; and we are to be
cooped up here like a parcel of sick chickens! I suppose
we shall have to recite history and French, and
shake out topsails, as usual."</p>

<p>"It's outrageous. I don't believe the fellows will
stand it," added Adler, who did not know how bad
the case was, until it had been rehearsed by Wilton,
who, in the absence of Shuffles, had become the leader
of a certain clique on board, given to taking opposite
views.</p>

<p>"But I don't see what we can do," said Monroe.</p>

<p>"We will do something. I won't stand it. If I
stay on board the ship to-morrow, it will be as a prisoner,"
answered Wilton.</p>

<p>"It's a hard case; but what can we do about it?"
asked Sanborn.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose we go to Lowington, and state the case
to him," suggested Adler.</p>

<p>"What's the use of that? Of course the first lieutenant
spoke by the card. He had his orders to say
what he did, and I'm sure they came from Lowington."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of that; but it would be
better to have it from him."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to ask Lowington for the day, if the
fellows want me to do so; but it won't do any more
good than it would to bark at the mainmast," continued
Wilton. "I have an idea in my head, if the fellows
will stand by me," he added, in a lower tone, as
he looked over the rail at the swinging boom, to which
the boats in constant use were made fast.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Monroe, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Keep shady, for a while. How many fellows can
we muster?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, don't stir the matter yet. Here comes Lowington
and we will talk to him first. Come, fellows,
let's make a dive at him."</p>

<p>Wilton, attended by his companions, walked up to
the principal, as he was going forward. Touching his
cap respectfully, as the discipline of the ship required,
he opened the case.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lowington, some of the students would like
to go on shore to-morrow, to celebrate the Fourth.
Can't we have liberty?"</p>

<p>"You know the rule; you should apply to the first
lieutenant for leave of absence," replied Mr. Lowington.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span></p>

<p>"We have, sir, and been refused."</p>

<p>"Then there is nothing more to be said. The first
lieutenant speaks with authority."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but are we to stay on board
all day to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"That is certainly the arrangement, Wilton."</p>

<p>"Some of us would like to celebrate the day, sir,
and we think it is rather hard to be obliged to do duty
on the Fourth of July."</p>

<p>"I intend to have the day celebrated in a proper
manner. I have made preparations for a gala day on
board."</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, we would rather go on shore."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, for your sake, that I shall be unable
to reverse the answer of the first lieutenant. If
I permit one or a dozen to go ashore, I cannot refuse
any, and all must go. I think the boys will be satisfied
with the arrangements I have made for the day."</p>

<p>"I never was kept in school on the Fourth of July
before, sir," growled Wilton.</p>

<p>"Then this will be a new event in your experience,"
answered Mr. Lowington, coldly, as he turned from
the petitioners, and went forward.</p>

<p>There were a great many wild boys on board of the
Young America, and it was morally impossible for the
whole crew to attend the celebration in the city, without
more or less of them getting into a scrape. They
had been kept on board for two months, and not
allowed to go on shore, except under the supervision
of one of the instructors; and to let any considerable
number of them loose on such a day as the Fourth of
July, would only be courting trouble, for they would
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
be all the more disorderly after the long period of
restraint.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington did not willingly deprive the boys
of any innocent gratification. He had faithfully considered
the matter of celebrating the day, and taken
the advice of the instructors on the subject. It had
been proposed to procure a band of music, and visit
the city in a body, under the usual discipline; but
there were many difficulties attending such a plan.
The boys were all the sons of rich men, and most of
them were abundantly supplied with pocket money.
As it would be impossible to prevent the escape of
some of them from the procession, in the crowded
streets, it was feared that their money would prove to
be "the root of all evil." The project had finally
been abandoned; and, as a substitute, a programme
for a celebration on board had been arranged, for there
the students would be entirely under the control of the
instructors, who would check all excesses. It was anticipated
that a few discontented spirits would grumble,
but no rebellion was expected.</p>

<p>Wilton and his companions were dissatisfied, and
disposed to be rash. They felt that they had been
harshly and cruelly denied a reasonable privilege.
The subject of celebrating the Fourth had been under
consideration for a long time among the boys, and it
had been generally believed that all hands would be
permitted to go on shore, with perfect liberty, on that
day; and many of them had already arranged their
plans for the occasion.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think now?" said Wilton, as
Mr. Lowington walked forward.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it's too bad," replied Adler. "It is meaner
than dirt to make us stay on board on the Fourth of
July."</p>

<p>"But I don't see how we are going to help ourselves,"
added Monroe, looking at Wilton for a solution
of this difficult problem.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Keep still; don't say a word here," continued
Wilton. "Scatter, now, and I will be on the top-gallant
forecastle in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Wilton strolled about the deck a short time, and
then went to the place of meeting, where he was soon
joined by the rest of the discontented pupils.</p>

<p>"How many fellows can we muster?" asked he,
when his associates in mischief had again gathered
around him.</p>

<p>"I know at least a dozen, who are up to anything,"
replied Monroe; "but some of them are in the other
watch. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you: There are the professors' barge and
the third cutter at the swinging boom. We will drop
into them when the instructors go down to supper,
and make for the shore. All the rest of the boats are
at the davits; and before they can get them into the
water, we shall be out of their reach. What do you
think of that for a plan!"</p>

<p>"I think it is a first-rate one. But hadn't we better
wait till the instructors turn in?" suggested Adler.</p>

<p>"No; the boats will all be hoisted up to the davits
at sunset. We must do it while the professors are at
supper, or not at all. We want eight oars for the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
barge, and six for the third cutter; that makes fourteen
fellows. Can we raise as many as that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think we can; we will try, at any rate."</p>

<p>"But you must look out, or some fellow will blow
the whole thing," added Wilton. "Mind whom you
speak to."</p>

<p>The trustworthiness of the various students was
canvassed, and it was decided what ones should be
invited to join the enterprise. The discontented boys
separated, and went to work with great caution to
obtain the needed recruits. Unfortunately, in such a
crowd of young men, there are always enough to
engage in any mischievous plot, and it is quite likely
that twice as many as were wanted could have been
obtained to man the boats in the runaway expedition.</p>

<p>Wilton missed Shuffles very much in arranging the
details of the present enterprise. While at the Brockway
Academy, they had plotted mischief so often that
each seemed to be necessary to the other. But Shuffles
had reformed; he was now third lieutenant of the
ship, and it was not safe to suggest a conspiracy to
him, for he would attempt to gain favor with the principal
by exposing or defeating it.</p>

<p>Yet Shuffles was so bold in thought, and so daring
in execution, that Wilton could hardly abandon the
hope of obtaining his assistance; besides, the third
lieutenant would be officer of the deck when the
professors went to supper, and might wink at their
departure in the boats, if he did not actually help
them off.</p>

<p>"Would you say anything to Shuffles?" asked
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
Wilton, still in doubt, of Monroe, as they happened
to meet again in the waist.</p>

<p>"To Shuffles!" exclaimed Monroe, in an energetic
whisper.</p>

<p>"I mean so."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I should as soon think of speaking
to Lowington himself."</p>

<p>"But Shuffles may join us. He is always in for a
good time."</p>

<p>"Why, you ninny, he is third lieutenant of the
ship."</p>

<p>"No matter if he is. I think Shuffles would like
to join us."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! He has been in office only three days,
and it would break him. He would be degraded to
the steerage," replied Monroe, who could not help
thinking that Wilton was beside himself in proposing
such a thing, and that the enterprise was doomed to
failure in such incompetent hands.</p>

<p>"If he won't join us, perhaps he will help us off.
He is officer of the deck, you know, in the second dog
watch."</p>

<p>"I know he is; but don't you open your mouth to
him. If you do, I'll back out at once."</p>

<p>"Back out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, back out. I believe you are crazy. Why
don't you go to Captain Carnes, and done with it?"
said Monroe, with energy.</p>

<p>"I haven't any hold on Carnes, and I have on
Shuffles."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the prudent conspirator,
curiously.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span></p>

<p>"If Shuffles won't join us, he won't blow on us,
you may depend upon that. He wouldn't dare to do
it. I could break him before sundown, if I chose,"
said Wilton, with conscious power.</p>

<p>"That alters the case."</p>

<p>"Of course, I shouldn't think of saying anything
to him, if I did not know what I was talking about.
I have him where the hair is short, and he knows it, as
well as I do."</p>

<p>"What is it, Wilton?"</p>

<p>"No matter what it is. When a thing is told me
in confidence, I keep it to myself; but if he turns
traitor to his cronies, he must look out for breakers.
He knows what it is."</p>

<p>"Well, if you can get him, he will be a first-rate
fellow to have."</p>

<p>"I think I can get him. Here he comes; you keep
out of the way, and I will see how deep the water is."</p>

<p>Monroe went forward to find a student to whom he
had been deputed to speak in the interest of the enterprise
leaving Wilton to grapple with the old lion of
mischief, whose teeth, however, seemed to have been
worn out in the cause.</p>

<p>"What's up, Wilton?" demanded the third lieutenant
who was now off duty, and therefore allowed
to speak to the crew, though it was a privilege of
which the officers seldom availed themselves.</p>

<p>"Who said anything was up?" asked Wilton.</p>

<p>"You look as though you meant something. What
were you and Ike Monroe talking about just now?"
continued Shuffles. "About me, I'll be bound, for you
kept looking at me, as though you meant something."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span></p>

<p>"What makes you think so? Have you heard
anything?" asked Wilton, fearful that the plot had
leaked out.</p>

<p>"Not a word? I only judged by your looks."</p>

<p>"I suppose if anything was up, you wouldn't have
anything to do with it now."</p>

<p>"Most decidedly, I should not. I like my present
position too well to fall out of it. I'm going to be
captain next term, if I can fetch it any way in the
world."</p>

<p>"You mean to be a flunky, just like the rest of
them. You are not the same fellow you used to be."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am."</p>

<p>"You are getting too big for your boots."</p>

<p>"You wrong me, Wilton. I'm just as good a
fellow as I ever was. I think I'm the best fellow in
the ship, and for that reason I want to be captain.
I'm ahead of Carnes so far on marks this month."</p>

<p>"Well, if you want to be the head flunky, I hope
you'll get it. We are not going ashore to-morrow,
they say," added Wilton, changing the topic to get
nearer to the business of the hour.</p>

<p>"So Pelham told me."</p>

<p>"Are you willing to stay on board and study, and
do ship's duty, on the Fourth of July?"</p>

<p>"We are going to celebrate."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know."</p>

<p>"We shall celebrate to-morrow just as we do every
day&mdash;as close prisoners on board the ship. I, for one,
don't like it, and I won't stand it."</p>

<p>"Won't you?" laughed Shuffles.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span></p>

<p>"When I say I won't, I mean so."</p>

<p>"O, you do&mdash;do you?"</p>

<p>"You better believe I do," added Wilton, shaking
his head resolutely.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going ashore, by hook or by crook."</p>

<p>"Better not get into any scrape."</p>

<p>"You say that as one of the flunkies."</p>

<p>"Well, you had better not say anything to me, for
I shall have to do my duty as an officer. Don't say
anything to me, and then I shall not know anything
about it."</p>

<p>"Humph!" sneered Wilton, not pleased with this
non-committal policy.</p>

<p>"I don't want to do anything mean with any of our
fellows; so don't say a word to me. I shall do my
duty as an officer, as I promised to do when I was
made third lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you will stop me, Shuffles, if
you see me going?" demanded Wilton.</p>

<p>"I do mean so; I promised faithfully to do my duty
as an officer, and I shall do it."</p>

<p>"See here, Bob Shuffles; you needn't talk to me in
that manner. I knew the ship's cable from a pint
of milk, and you can't come the flunky over me."</p>

<p>"I'm going to do just as you would do if you were
in my place. I won't hear a word about any of your
plans."</p>

<p>"But will you interfere with them?"</p>

<p>"If it is my duty to do so, I shall. I intend to obey
orders; and if I have the deck, I shall keep things
straight, whatever happens."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span></p>

<p>"Lowington don't know you as well as I do."</p>

<p>"No matter if he don't; he shall have no fault to
find with me this term, if I can help it."</p>

<p>"It's no use for me to mince the matter with you,
Bob Shuffles. We understand each other too well for
that. Something's up."</p>

<p>Shuffles turned on his heel, and was about to walk
away.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, Shuffles," continued Wilton.
"I won't tell you what's up, but I'll tell you this; if
you interfere with what I do, or with what the fellows
with me do, I'll tell Lowington about the mutiny&mdash;I
will, as sure as your name is Bob Shuffles. Do you
understand me?"</p>

<p>"Well, I do; and it seems to me that sounds very
much like a threat."</p>

<p>"Call it what you like. If you turn traitor to our
fellows, you must stand the racket of it. You are not
a saint just yet, and those that live in glass houses
musn't throw stones."</p>

<p>"I believe I haven't played false to any of our fellows.
If I don't choose to get into any scrape with
them, I have a right to keep out. That's all I've got
to say."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do, Shuffles? Our
fellows will want to know."</p>

<p>"I'm going to do my duty," replied the third lieutenant
as he walked away, regardless of the efforts
of his companion to detain him.</p>

<p>Shuffles was experiencing the truth of the old
maxim, that honesty is the best policy. It is to be
regretted that his present devotion to duty had no
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
higher incentive than mere policy; but it may be
hoped of those who do their duty from low motives,
that they may gather inspiration even from their politic
fidelity to obey its behests from higher motives. The
third lieutenant of the Young America intended to
keep the promise he had made in accepting his office,
simply because it would pay best.</p>

<p>Wilton and his confederates had no difficulty in
making up the required number of discontents and
malcontents before six o'clock, which was the time
fixed for carrying out the enterprise they had planned.
Some of the recruits joined because they anticipated a
good time in the city in celebrating the Fourth, and
others from a mere love of mischief and excitement.
The details of the scheme had been carefully elaborated
by Monroe and Wilton, after the ranks of the
conspirators were full. Having learned a valuable
lesson from the daily discipline of the ship, the mischief
was certainly well planned. Each boy was
assigned to a particular position in the boats, and
knew on what thwart he was to sit, and which oar he
was to pull.</p>

<p>Wilton and Monroe, as the master spirits of the enterprise
were to run out first on the swinging boom,
and slide down the painters, each into the boat he was
to command. The others were to follow in the same
way, descending from the boom, for it was not considered
prudent to run the boats up to the gangway,
where some enthusiastic officer might easily interfere
with the plan, which was to depend for its success
upon the celerity of its execution.</p>

<p>When four bells struck, the professors went down to
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
their evening meal, as usual, and the boatswain piped
the port watch to supper, the starboard watch having
taken theirs at three bells, or half past five. Wilton
gave a low whistle, when Shuffles, officer of the deck,
was abaft the mizzenmast, with his back to the runaways
who had gathered in the waist, and were waiting
for the signal.</p>

<p>"Be lively, fellows," said the leader of the enterprise,
as he sprang over the rail, and ran out on the boom,
followed by Monroe.</p>

<p>The others, in the order in which they had been
instructed, did the same. About half of them were
on the boom, when the movement was reported to the
officer of the deck by the midshipman on duty in the
waist. Shuffles rushed forward, now understanding,
for the first time, the intentions of Wilton; and true to
the inspiration of fidelity, he set about defeating the
object of "our fellows."</p>

<p>The studding-sail boom, to which the boats were
fastened, was supported by a topping-lift from above,
and kept in position, at right angles with the side of
the ship, by guys extending forward and aft.</p>

<p>"Stand by that fore guy!" shouted Shuffles, as he
sprang upon the rail. "Cast off!"</p>

<p>"Lively, fellows!" said Wilton, when he saw that
the third lieutenant intended to swing in the boom to
the ship's side.</p>

<p>"Stand by the after guy of the studding-sail boom!"
continued Shuffles, with becoming energy.</p>

<p>Both his orders were promptly obeyed; but seeing
that his movement would be too late, he rushed to the
topping-lift, and cast it off, causing the swinging boom
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
to drop into the water, just as the last boy was
about to slide down into the professors' boat. Of
course the luckless fellow went into the water; but
he was promptly picked up by his companions in
mischief.</p>

<p>"If I'm caught, Bob Shuffles, you look out for
breakers!" cried Wilton, as the third lieutenant
appeared at the gangway again.</p>

<p>The tide was coming in, and the boats swung so far
abaft the boom that it had fallen clear of them when
it dropped into the water. Wilton and Monroe were
prompt to avail themselves of their present success,
and the boys sat in the boats, with their oars up, ready
to pull as soon as the order was given.</p>

<p>"Let fall!" said Wilton; and the eight oars of the
professors' barge dropped into the water, and the
rowers placed them in readiness for the first stroke.</p>

<p>Monroe, in the third cutter, followed the example
of his principal, and was hardly a second behind him.</p>

<p>"Give way!" added Wilton.</p>

<p>"Give way!" repeated Monroe; and the two boats
gathered way and darted off towards the nearest point
of the shore.</p>

<p>Thus far the enterprise of "our fellows" was entirely
successful, and Shuffles stood on the gangway,
chagrined at the defeat which had attended his efforts
to prevent the escape of the runaways.</p>

<p>"Stand by to clear away the first cutter!" shouted
he, suddenly and with energy, as he made his way to
the davits, where the boat indicated was suspended.</p>

<p>"Cast off the gripes, and man the falls!" he continued
when the watch were collected at the scene of
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
action. "Mr. Kendall, you will inform the captain
what has happened."</p>

<p>Within three minutes, the first cutter was in the
water, for the crew had been frequently exercised in
the evolution of lowering boats, and performed it with
remarkable facility for boys. Before the first cutter
touched the water, the captain, the principal, and all
the professors, came on deck.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington was entirely cool, though everybody
else appeared to be intensely excited. The crew of
the first cutter were piped away, and at the principal's
suggestion, the third lieutenant was sent off in the
boat to prevent the landing of the rebellious pupils.</p>

<p>"Up oars! Let fall! Give way!" said Shuffles,
in the boat, delivering his orders in rapid succession;
and the first cutter darted off in chase of the runaways.</p>

<h4>THE FOURTH OF JULY.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>The first cutter was manned by her regular crew,
who had been trained with the utmost care to
pull together, while Wilton, in the professors' barge,
which was of the same size, had some very indifferent
oarsmen. The runaways had made up their force of
such material as they could obtain, and though all
were somewhat accustomed to rowing, they had not
been drilled to work together; they were not the
unit of power in pulling a boat. Shuffles, therefore,
had a manifest advantage, and he was determined to
bring back the fugitives.</p>

<p>The second cutter, in charge of Paul Kendall, was
cleared away, and, with Mr. Lowington and Mr.
Fluxion on board, left the ship to take part in the pursuit.
The chase promised to be an exciting one, for
Wilton and Monroe were straining every nerve to
reach the shore before they were overtaken. They
were making for the nearest land, and having just the
number of hands required to pull the boat, each of
them was obliged to use an oar himself. They had
no coxswains, and Wilton, at the bow oar of the professors'
barge, could not see what was ahead, though
he kept the pursuing boats in full view.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span></p>

<p>The nearest land, not more than half a mile from
the ship, was a point covered with salt marsh, above
which was a cove, whose opening was about ten rods
in width. Wilton was making for the point below the
cove, but his calculations were made without judgment
or discretion. If he reached the land, his party would
be obliged to walk a mile in order to get round the
cove, on a narrow strip of marsh, where they might
be intercepted. But the fatal defect in his plan of
operations was a failure to consider the depth of
water between the ship and the point. The flow
of the tide from the cove, while it kept a clear channel
through the entrance, had formed a bar off the
tongue of land on the seaward side of it, which was
bare at half tide, and was now just covered. Wilton
was pulling for this bar, with all the strength of his
crew.</p>

<p>Shuffles was prompt to observe the mistake of his
late crony, and just as prompt to profit by it. The
first cutter was gaining rapidly on the chase; but
Shuffles, as she reached the border of the main channel,
ordered his coxswain to keep the boat's head
towards the entrance of the cove.</p>

<p>"We shall never catch them on this tack," said the
coxswain of the cutter, who knew nothing about
the bar.</p>

<p>"I think we shall," replied the third lieutenant,
confidently.</p>

<p>"We are not going towards the point."</p>

<p>"That's very true, and the professors' barge will not
go much farther in that direction. Pull steady, my
lads; don't hurry yourselves. There is plenty of time."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span></p>

<p>The coxswain thought his superior officer was
taking the matter very coolly, and knowing of the
intimacy which had formerly subsisted between Shuffles
and Wilton, he was ready to conclude that the
third lieutenant was willing to permit the escape of
"our fellows." While he was putting this construction
on the conduct of his superior, the professors'
barge "took the ground," and stuck fast.</p>

<p>"They're aground, Mr. Shuffles," said the coxswain.</p>

<p>"There's just where I expected them to be," answered
Shuffles, quietly.</p>

<p>"Shall I run towards them?"</p>

<p>"No; keep her as she is. There isn't more than a
foot of water anywhere between them and the point."</p>

<p>The third cutter, being a smaller boat than the professors'
barge, did not touch the bar as soon as her
consort; but Monroe saw that his craft could not land
her party on the point at that stage of the tide, and he
ordered his crew first to lay on their oars, and then to
back water. Wilton's boat was aground at the bow,
and when he had sent part of his crew aft, she was
easily pushed off the bar. By this delay he had lost
the chance of landing at the point, and his only alternative
was to pull up to the cove; but in doing so, it
would be impossible to avoid the first cutter, which
had now secured a position off the mouth of the little
bay.</p>

<p>"Stand by to lay on your oars," said the coxswain
of the first cutter, as directed by the lieutenant in command.
"Oars!"</p>

<p>The crew ceased rowing, and laying on their oars,
waited the next movement of the runaways. In the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
mean time the second cutter was well away from the
ship, and Mr. Lowington, promptly comprehending
the intentions of the third lieutenant, directed the
officer in command to pull towards the boats on
the bar, keeping well to seaward, in order to prevent
them from escaping in that direction.</p>

<p>Wilton realized that he was cornered, and hoping
that Shuffles would not be over-zealous in the discharge
of his duty, directed his course towards the
opening of the cove. A few strokes brought him
within hailing distance of the first cutter.</p>

<p>"No use, Wilton," said Shuffles, laughing. "You
may as well pull for the ship. It's all up with you."</p>

<p>But the leader of the runaways, instead of heeding
this good advice, attempted to push by astern of the
first cutter.</p>

<p>"Stern, all! Give way!" shouted Shuffles, sharply.
"Coxswain, stand by with your stern line!"</p>

<p>It was generally understood that the third lieutenant
of the Young America was a fighting character, and
that he could whip any officer or seaman in the ship,
though his prowess had not been practically demonstrated.
Shuffles took the stern line himself, instead
of intrusting the duty to the coxswain. He intended
to grapple the bow of the professors' barge, and
make fast to it with the rope; but the cutter did
not gather way enough in season to do this. As she
backed, she fouled the oars of the barge, and Shuffles
secured a firm hold of her stern.</p>

</div>


<p>"What are you doing, Bob Shuffles?" demanded
Wilton, angry, when he saw that his late crony was
fully in earnest.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span></p>

<p>The third lieutenant made no reply; but passing his
rope through a ring in the stern of the barge, he made
it fast, and then pushed the cutter off from her. When
the line had run out about a fathom, he secured the
end he held in his hand to the after thwart of his own
boat. Thus the first cutter and the barge were lashed
together, stern to stern.</p>

<p>"Cast off that rope!" shouted Wilton to the stroke
oarsman in the barge.</p>

<p>"Don't you touch it, my lad," interposed Shuffles,
when the boy attempted to obey the order of his
leader. "If you attempt it, you will purchase a sore
head."</p>

<p>The third lieutenant had picked up a boat-hook, and
stood ready to rap any of the barge's crew who might
attempt to cast off the line by which the boats were
fastened together. No one was disposed to cross the
purposes of so formidable a person as Shuffles, and
the stroke oarsman did not obey the order of Wilton.
It would not be safe to do so.</p>

<p>"Now, Wilton, what do you say?" demanded Shuffles,
a smile of triumph playing upon his face, which
was very aggravating to the leader of the runaways.
"Will you go back to the ship, or not?"</p>

<p>"No, of course I won't," replied the discomfited
chief of the malcontents.</p>

<p>"You had better, my dear fellow. There comes
Mr. Lowington."</p>

<p>"I didn't think this of you, Bob Shuffles," said
Wilton, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I told you I should do my duty; and I shall, to
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
the end. If you will return, all right; if not, I shall
take you back."</p>

<p>"No, you won't."</p>

<p>"I think I will," added the third lieutenant, quietly.
"Stand by to give way!" he continued, to the coxswain.</p>

<p>"Two can play at that game," said Wilton, as he
gave the same order to his crew.</p>

<p>"Give way!" shouted the coxswain of the first
cutter, with energy.</p>

<p>"Give way!" repeated Wilton, in the barge.</p>

<p>The rope straightened, Shuffles stood up in the
stern-sheets of the cutter, to prevent the line from
being cast off, and the contest began, to ascertain
which should drag the other. It was rather ludicrous,
in spite of the serious question of discipline
involved in the affair, and the boys in the cutter
were intensely amused, as well as excited. Both
crews struggled with all their might, and each leader
urged his followers to renewed exertions.</p>

<p>The discipline of the first cutter was on the point of
carrying the contest in favor of law and order, when
Monroe, seeing that his friend was nearly worsted,
backed the third cutter up to the bow of the barge,
and took her painter on board, which he made fast at
the stern. Resuming his oar, he ordered his crew to
give way together. Then law and order appealed to
be at a discount, for the eight oarsmen in the first
cutter were not a match, even in the cause of discipline,
against the fourteen in the barge and third
cutter.</p>

<p>Shuffles did not give it up, notwithstanding the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
great odds against him. Letting out the stern line
far enough to allow space for a new manoeuvre, he directed
the starboard oarsmen to lay on their oars, while
those on the port side pulled the boat round. Then
all gave way together, and the barge was dragged
round sideways, until her oars fouled with those of
Monroe's boat. At this stage of the exciting proceedings
the second cutter came up with the principal.</p>

<p>Mr. Fluxion sat in the stern-sheets, shaking his
sides with laughter at the singular contest which was
going on; but Mr. Lowington, though evidently
amused, maintained his gravity, and was as dignified
as usual. The appearance of the principal ended the
struggle. A glance from him was quite sufficient
to take all the stiffening out of the runaways, and
even Wilton, though he talked valiantly behind Mr.
Lowington's back, and neglected even to give him the
simple title of "mister," had not the courage to resist
the strong arm of his authority. As the second cutter
backed up to the barge, the principal stepped on
board of her, and took a seat in the stern-sheets.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, you will return to the ship,"
said Mr. Lowington, sternly, as he took the tiller-ropes
in his hands. "Give way!"</p>

<p>The malcontents had no thought of further resistance.
The presence of the principal was sufficient
to overcome all insubordination; they did not dare to
disobey him. Mechanically they bent to their oars,
and without a word pulled back to the ship.</p>

<p>Mr. Fluxion, by direction of Mr. Lowington, had
taken his place in Monroe's boat, and followed the
barge, the two cutters bringing up the rear. This was
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
the first instance of flagrant insubordination which had
occurred since the organization of the ship's company,
and the students were not a little anxious to learn how
it would be treated. It was singular that Shuffles,
who on shore had always been the ringleader in enterprises
of mischief, had been the means of defeating
the scheme of the runaways.</p>

<p>The boats were hoisted up at the davits, and the
boatswain was ordered to pipe all hands on deck.
The principal looked calm, but stern, as he took the
position on the hatch which he usually occupied when
he addressed the students.</p>

<p>"Wilton and Monroe," said he.</p>

<p>The culprits came forward, hanging their heads
with shame.</p>

<p>"I learn that you are the ringleaders in this movement.
Is it so?"</p>

<p>"I suppose we are," replied Wilton.</p>

<p>"Who proposed the plan?"</p>

<p>"Wilton first spoke to me about it," answered
Monroe.</p>

<p>"And you induced the others to join you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"As the ringleaders, Wilton and Monroe will lose
twenty marks each, and remain in their mess rooms
to-morrow. The other twelve lose ten marks each,"
continued Mr. Lowington. "Young gentlemen, those
who have engaged in this scheme are not to be
trusted. I have nothing further to say."</p>

<p>The crew were dismissed, and all the students were
disposed to laugh at the mildness of the punishment,
compared with the enormity of the offence.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Shuffles," said the principal, as he stepped
down from the hatch, "I am very much obliged to
you for the zeal and energy which you have exhibited
in the discharge of your duty. Not only was your
disposition to do your duty highly commendable, but
your plans displayed skill and forethought."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied the third lieutenant; "I
am very glad to have pleased you."</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington bowed, and descended to the cabin
to finish his supper, which had been interrupted by
the event described. What the professors said about
the affair was not known to the boys; but Shuffles
was warmly praised for the moderate but skilful measures
he had used in the capture of the rebels.</p>

<p>At sundown, a shore boat came alongside with an
abundant supply of fireworks, which had been ordered
by Mr. Lowington. They were hoisted on board, and
deposited in a safe place. At the usual hour, the boys
turned in to dream of the good time which these squibs
and crackers suggested to them&mdash;all but Monroe and
Wilton, who had something else to think about. The
latter was disappointed and surly, while the former
congratulated himself upon getting out of the scrape
so easily. Wilton was very angry with Shuffles, who
might have permitted him to land, if he had been so
disposed; and he determined to take what he considered
an ample vengeance upon the traitor. As soon
as he had an opportunity to speak to Mr. Lowington,
he intended to tell him all about the plan for a mutiny,
and he was fully satisfied that Shuffles would be sent
in disgrace from his pleasant position in the after
cabin, to take up his abode in the steerage again.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the ever-glorious Fourth, all
hands were mustered on the deck of the Young America
at four o'clock. Crackers were served out, and
for two hours there was a tremendous racket from
stern to stern, among the younger boys. At six
o'clock, the port watch were piped to breakfast, and
all the crackers having been burned, the decks were
swept, and everything put in perfect order, by the
starboard watch. A band of music, engaged for the
day, came off, and the enlivening strains of the national
airs sounded through the ship.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock, when all hands had breakfasted,
an hour earlier than usual, the crew were piped to
muster, wondering, as they always did, what was
going to be done.</p>

<p>"All hands, up anchor ahoy!" shouted the boatswain
prompted by the first lieutenant; but this order
was so common in the every-day practice of the crew,
that no one supposed it had any unusual significance;
and some of the boys even began to grumble at being
compelled to go through the routine of ship's work on
the Fourth of July.</p>

<p>"Bring to on the cable, and unbitt!" continued the
officer in command. "Ship the capstan bars, and
swifter them! Heave in the cable to a short stay!"</p>

<p>These orders were duly executed, under the direction
of the various officers at their stations.</p>

<p>"Avast heaving!" called the first master. "Anchor
apeak, sir," he reported to the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Pawl the capstan, stopper the cable, and unship
the bars!" added the executive officers, all of which
was done, and duly reported.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span></p>

<p>"Stations for loosing topsails!" which were shaken
out by the ordinary routine, sheeted home, and hoisted
up.</p>

<p>"Forecastlemen, loose the head sails! After-guard,
clear away the spanker! Man the capstan bars, ship
and swifter them! Heave around!"</p>

<p>This last was a manoeuvre which the crew had
never before been called upon to perform; and the
order sent a thrill of delight to all hearts. The cable
had often been heaved to a short stay, that is, so that
it run nearly up and down; but that was as far as
they had ever before been permitted to proceed. Now,
with the anchor apeak, they were ordered to the capstan
again, and they realized that the Young America
was actually going to sea. The command kindled an
enthusiasm which glowed on every face. The ship
was going out of the harbor, and the evil doers in the
mess rooms below were to be pitied.</p>

<p>"Anchor aweigh, sir," reported the excited boatswain
who, however, had to be prompted in this instance
by Peaks, for it had never been in that position
before since it first hooked the mud in Brockway
harbor.</p>

<p>"Anchor aweigh, sir," repeated the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Man the jib and flying-jib halyards!" said the
first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Anchor's at the bow, sir," said the boatswain,
which report went through the same channels as
before, till it reached the executive officer.</p>

<p>"Hoist away on the jib and flying-jib halyards!
Avast heaving! Pawl the capstan! Stopper the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
cable! Cat and fish the anchor!" shouted the first
lieutenant. "Port the helm!"</p>

<p>The Young America was clear of the ground. The
fore topsail, which had been trimmed to the fresh
breeze, was full, and the ship began to gather headway.
Two seamen had been placed at the wheel,
under the charge of the quartermaster. The boys had
often "made believe" do these things, but now they
were real. The vessel was actually moving through
the water, and they could hardly contain themselves,
so exhilarating was the scene.</p>

<p>"Steady!" said the first lieutenant, when the ship
had come up to her intended course.</p>

<p>"Steady, sir," repeated the quartermaster in charge
of the helm.</p>

<p>"Stand by to set the spanker," added the first
lieutenant. "Man the outhaul! Cast off the brails,
and loose the vangs!"</p>

<p>The after-guard, which is the portion of the ship's
company stationed on the quarter-deck, or abaft the
mizzenmast, obeyed this order, and stood ready to set
the spanker, which is the aftermost sail.</p>

<p>"Walk away with the outhaul!" and the after-guard
ran off with the rope, which drew the sail out
into its place on the gaff. "Stand by the spanker
sheet&mdash;let it out!"</p>

<p>"You must attend to your main and mizzen topsails
Mr. Pelham," said the principal, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Man the fore and main braces!" said the executive
officer; and the young seamen sprang to their
stations. "Let go and haul!"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span></p>

<p>The main and the mizzen topsails were thus trimmed,
so that they took the wind.</p>

<p>"That was very well done, Captain Carnes, though
your crew need more practice. They are very much
excited," said Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder, sir; I think none of them
knew we were going out of the harbor," replied the
captain.</p>

<p>"I am glad they enjoy it," added the principal,
"though I should not have left the anchorage, except
as a substitute for the Fourth of July celebration."</p>

<p>"They will like this much better than going to the
city."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt on that point; and last evening,
when those students wished to run away, I was tempted
to punish their disobedience by letting them go.
The wind is pretty fresh, Captain Carnes, but I think
you may set the top-gallant sails."</p>

<p>The captain gave the order to the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Aloft, sail-loosers of the top-gallant sails!" shouted
Mr. Pelham; and the eager young salts dashed up
the rigging. "Lay out! Loose! Let fall! Man
your sheets and halyards! Sheets home, and hoist
away!"</p>

<p>The addition of the top-gallant sails was sensibly
felt by the Young America; and, "taking a bone in
her teeth," she careened over, and dashed away merrily
on her course.</p>

<p>The band played Hail, Columbia, and as the ship
passed the fort, the crew mounted the rigging and gave
three cheers. The excitement on board was immense,
and never was Independence Day more thoroughly
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
and enthusiastically enjoyed. The officers and crew
were at the height of felicity, as the gallant little ship
bowled over the waves, threading her way through the
channels between the numerous islands of the bay.</p>

<p>"Can't we put on any more sail, Mr. Lowington?"
asked Captain Carnes, as he met the principal on the
quarter-deck.</p>

<p>"Not at present. We are making very good progress
now."</p>

<p>"The boys want to see all sail on her."</p>

<p>"The wind is blowing half a gale now," added Mr.
Lowington, with a smile. "I think we shall be able
to give them quite enough of it when we get out into
blue water. I'm afraid you will lose half your crew
before noon!"</p>

<p>"Lose them?"</p>

<p>"By seasickness, I mean."</p>

<p>"Do you think they will be sick, sir?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it. Many of them never saw
the ocean before, and never looked upon a ship till
they came on board of the Young America. I don't
think it would be prudent to put on all sail, until
we know what force we are to have to handle the
ship."</p>

<p>"They don't look like being seasick at present."</p>

<p>"Wait till we get out into the heavy sea," laughed
the principal, as he went forward.</p>

<p>At eight bells the ship was abreast of the last island,
and she began to pitch and roll a little, though the
motion was hardly perceptible, until she was well off
from the land. Professor Paradyme was the first victim
of seasickness, and the boys all laughed when
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
they saw the woe-begone expression on the face of
the learned man; but some of those who laughed the
loudest were the first to be taken by the ridiculous
malady.</p>

<p>The Young America pitched and rolled heavily as
she receded from the land, and nothing more was said
by the students about putting on more sail. The
spray broke over the bow, and washed the decks; but
most of the boys enjoyed the scene as they had never
enjoyed anything before.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, sir?" demanded Mr.
Lowington, as he went forward, and discovered Wilton
skulking under the lee of the foremast. "You
were told to stay in your mess room, sir!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't, sir," whined the culprit.</p>

<p>"You could, and you will."</p>

<p>"I was seasick, sir."</p>

<p>"I can't help it; you must stay in your mess room,"
added the principal, sternly.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, I will obey orders if you will
let me stay on deck," said Wilton, humbly.</p>

<p>"No; return to your room?" and Wilton was compelled
to obey.</p>

<p>It was a very severe punishment to him and Monroe
to be obliged to stay in the steerage during the
first trip of the Young America.</p>

<h4>HEAVING THE LOG.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>The Young America, under topsails and top-gallant
sails, was making about ten knots an
hour. After passing the last island in the bay, she
was headed to the south-east, which brought the wind
over the starboard quarter. The ship was of the
clipper class, though not as sharp as many of this
model. It was found that her sailing ability was
excellent, and Mr. Lowington and Mr. Fluxion expressed
much satisfaction at her performance, both in
respect of speed and weatherly qualities.</p>

<p>When the ship left her moorings, the principal had
not decided where to go, or how long to remain at sea,
intending to be governed by the circumstances of the
hour. It had never been his purpose to keep her at
one anchorage, but to go from port to port, remaining
a few days or a few weeks at each, as the discipline of
the ship and the progress of the boys in their studies
suggested. There were many elements of seamanship
which could not be effectively practised while the
ship lay at anchor, such as heaving the log, sounding
and steering, though the boys had been carefully
instructed in the theory of these operations.</p>

<p>The instructor in mathematics, the boatswain, the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
carpenter, and the sailmaker, all of whom were good
seamen, were in great demand as soon as the ship was
under way; but when she had sea-room enough, the
helm was handed over to the boys, under the charge
of a juvenile quartermaster. Peaks stood by, and
gave the necessary directions, till the students were
able to do the work themselves.</p>

<p>"Now, my lads, we will heave the log," said the
boatswain, when the ship was well out from the land.</p>

<p>"We know how to do that," replied Smith, one of
the quartermasters.</p>

<p>"I dare say you do, young gentlemen; but in my
opinion, you can't do it. You know how to write a
psalm, but I don't believe you could write one,"
added Peaks. "You have to learn how to do these
things by the feeling, so that they will do themselves,
so to speak. After-guard, stand by to haul in the log-line.
Here, quartermaster, you will hold the glass,
and the officer of the deck will throw the chip."</p>

<p>"We know all about it, Mr. Peaks," repeated
Smith.</p>

<p>"I know you do; but you can't tell within five knots
how fast the ship is going," laughed the boatswain.
"Let's do it right a few times, and then you can be
trusted."</p>

<p>The quartermaster took the glass, and Gordon, then
officer of the watch, the chip, which he cast into the
water over the stern of the ship.</p>

<p>"Turn!" said he, when the stray line had run
out.</p>

<p>Now, Smith, at this particular moment, was watching
a vessel over the quarter, and he did not instantly
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
turn the glass, as he should have done; but Peaks
said nothing.</p>

<p>"Up!" cried the quartermaster, when the sand had
all run through the glass.</p>

<p>Gordon stopped the reel from which the line was
running out, and noted the mark.</p>

<p>"Seven knots," said he.</p>

<p>"Not right," replied the boatswain, sharply. "This
ship is going nine or ten knots an hour, and any man
who has snuffed salt water for six months could guess
nearer than you make it. Now try it once again, and
if you don't hit nearer than that next time, you may
as well throw the reel overboard, and hire a Yankee
to guess the rate of sailing."</p>

<p>"I thought we knew all about it," added Smith.</p>

<p>"I think you do, young gentlemen; but you were
star-gazing when you ought to have been all attention.
The line ran out two or three knots before you turned
the glass."</p>

<p>Gordon took the chip again. It was a thin piece
of board, in the form of a quarter circle. The round
side was loaded with just lead enough to make it float
upright in the water. The log-line was fastened to
the chip, just us a boy loops a kite, two strings being
attached at each end of the circular side, while the
one at the angle is tied to a peg, which is inserted in a
hole, just hard enough to keep it in place, while there
is no extra strain on the board, but which can be drawn
out with a smart pull. When the log-line has run out
as far as desired, there would be some difficulty in
hauling in the chip while it was upright in the water;
but a sudden jerk draws the peg at the angle, and
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
permits the board to lie flat, in which position the
water offers the least resistance to its passage.</p>

<p>The half-minute glass used on board the Young
America, held by the quartermaster, was like an hour
glass, and contained just sand enough to pass through
the hole in the neck in thirty seconds. The log-line
was one hundred and fifty fathoms in length, and was
wound on a reel, which turned very easily, so that the
resistance of the chip to the water would unwind it.
The log-line is divided into certain spaces called knots,
the length of each of which is the same fractional part
of a mile that a half minute is of an hour. If there
be sixty-one hundred and twenty feet in a nautical
mile, or the sixtieth part of a degree of a great circle,
which is not far from accurate, and the ship be
going ten knots an hour, she will run sixty-one
thousand two hundred feet in an hour. If the chip
were thrown overboard at eight o'clock, and the line
were long enough, the ship would have run out sixty-one
thousand two hundred feet, or ten miles, at nine
o'clock, or in one hour. In one minute she would run
one sixtieth of sixty-one thousand two hundred feet,
which is ten hundred and twenty feet; in half a
minute, five hundred and ten feet.</p>

<p>The half-minute glass is the measure of time generally
used in heaving the log. While the sand is
dropping through, the line runs out five hundred and
ten feet, the ship going ten knots an hour being the
basis of the calculation. One knot, therefore, will be
fifty-one feet. If the line pays out five hundred and
ten feet in thirty seconds, by the glass, the ship is
going ten knots an hour. If it pays out four hundred
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
and eight feet in half a minute, or eight hundred and
sixteen feet in a minute, she will pay out a mile in as
many minutes as eight hundred and sixteen feet is
contained in sixty-one hundred and twenty feet, which
is seven and a half minutes. Then the ship goes a
mile in seven and a half minutes, or eight miles an
hour.</p>

<p>A knot on the log-line is therefore invariably fifty-one
feet; and the number of knots of the line run out
in half a minute indicates also the ship's speed per
hour, for fifty-one feet is the same part of a nautical
mile that half a minute is of an hour. The calculations
are given without allowances, merely to show
the principle; and both the glass and the line are
modified in practice.</p>

<p>On board the Young America, ten fathoms were
allowed for "stray line;" this length of line being
permitted to run out before the measuring commenced,
in order to get the chip clear of thee eddies in the wake
of the ship. The ten fathoms were indicated by a
white rag, drawn through the line; and when the
officer paying out comes to this mark, he orders the
quartermaster to turn the glass, and the operation
actually begins. At every fifty-one feet (or forty-seven
and six tenths, making the allowances) there is
a mark&mdash;a bit of leather, or two or more knots.
The instant the sands have all run through the glass,
the quartermaster says, "Up," and the officer notes the
mark to which the line has run out. Half and quarter
knots are indicated on the line.</p>

<p>"Now, quartermaster, mind your eye. When the
officer of the deck says, 'Turn,' you repeat the word
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
after him, to show that you are alive," continued
Peaks.</p>

<p>"Ready!" said Gordon.</p>

<p>"Ready!" replied Smith.</p>

<p>The lieutenant threw the chip into the water, and
when the stray line had run off, he gave the word to
turn the glass.</p>

<p>"Turn!" repeated Smith.</p>

<p>Gordon eased off the log-line, so that nothing should
prevent it from running easily.</p>

<p>"Up!" shouted Smith; and Gordon stopped the
line.</p>

<p>"Very well," added Peaks. "What's the mark?"</p>

<p>"Ten and a quarter," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"That sounds more like it. I knew this ship was
going more than seven knots. You see, young
gentlemen, you can't catch flies and tend the log-line
at the same time. Now, you may try it over
again."</p>

<p>The experiment was repeated, with the same result.
Other officers and seamen were called to the
quarter-deck, and the training in heaving the log
continued, until a reasonable degree of proficiency
was attained.</p>

<p>"Land ho!" cried the lookout on the top-gallant
forecastle, at about eleven o'clock in the forenoon.</p>

<p>"Where away?" called the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>"Dead ahead, sir."</p>

<p>"What is that land, Mr. Lowington?" asked Paul
Kendall.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you should study your map more. Look at
the compass, and tell me how she heads."</p>

<p>"South-east, sir," replied Paul, after looking into
the binnacle.</p>

<p>"Now, what land lies south-east of Brockway Harbor?"
asked the principal.</p>

<p>"Cape Cod, I think."</p>

<p>"You are right; then that must be Cape Cod."</p>

<p>"Is it, really?"</p>

<p>"Certainly it is," laughed Mr. Lowington. "Have
you no faith in your map?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think we could be anywhere near Cape
Cod. I thought it was farther off," added Paul, who
seemed to be amazed to think they had actually crossed
Massachusetts Bay.</p>

<p>"The land you see is Race Point, which is about
forty miles from the entrance to the bay, at the head
of which Brockway is located. We have been making
about ten knots an hour, and our calculations seem to
be very accurate. By one o'clock we shall come to
anchor in Provincetown Harbor."</p>

<p>This prediction was fully verified, and the Young
America was moored off the town. Those who had
been seasick recovered as soon as the motion of the
ship ceased; and when everything aloft and on deck
had been made snug, the crew were piped to dinner.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, part of the students were permitted
to go on shore; the band played, and several
boat-races took place, very much to the delight of
the people on shore, as well as those on board. At
six o'clock the ship was opened for the reception
of visitors, who came off in large numbers to inspect
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
the vessel. After dark there was a brilliant display
of fireworks, and the Young America blazed with
blue-lights and Roman candles, set off by boys on
the cross-trees, and at the yard-arms. At ten the festivities
closed, and all was still in the steerage and on
deck.</p>

<p>The next morning, the ship got under way, and
stood out of the harbor, bound for Brockway again.
She had a light breeze, and a smooth time, and the
boys had the satisfaction of seeing every rag of canvas
spread, including studding-sails alow and aloft;
but it was not till after dark that the ship came to
anchor at her former moorings.</p>

<p>Wilton and Monroe were released from confinement
in the morning, and permitted to go on deck. Whatever
their shipmates might have said, they felt that they
had been severely punished, especially as they had
failed in their runaway expedition. Wilton did not
feel any more kindly towards Shuffles when he was
released than when he had been ordered to his room.
He felt that his late crony had been a traitor, and he
was unable to take any higher view of the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Wilton," said Mr. Lowington, when he met the
runaway on deck, the day after the Fourth, "I told
you that you had made a mistake. Do you believe
it yet?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I do, sir."</p>

<p>"You suppose you do! Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I think I did make a mistake," replied
Wilton, who found it very hard to acknowledge the
fact.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not refer to your punishment, when I allude
to the consequences of your misdeed, for that was very
light. You have fallen very low in the estimation of
your superiors."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Mr. Shuffles, sir?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean the officers exclusively, though I
believe they have a proper respect for the discipline of
the ship."</p>

<p>"I don't think Shuffles need to say anything."</p>

<p>"He hasn't said anything."</p>

<p>"He is worse than I am."</p>

<p>"Shuffles has done very well, and merits the approbation
of the principal and the instructors."</p>

<p>"They don't know him as well as I do," growled
Wilton.</p>

<p>"They probably know him better. Your remarks
do not exhibit a proper spirit towards an officer. He
defeated your plan to escape, but he did no more than
his duty. He would have been blamed, perhaps punished,
if he had done any less."</p>

<p>"I don't find any fault with him for doing his duty,
but I don't like to be snubbed by one who is worse
than I am. If you knew what I know, sir, you would
turn him out of the after cabin."</p>

<p>"Then it is fortunate for him that I don't know
what you know," replied Mr. Lowington, sternly.
"If you wish to injure him in my estimation, you
will not succeed."</p>

<p>"He is going to get up a mutiny one of these days.
He told me all about it," continued Wilton, desperately,
when he found that the principal was in no
mood to listen to his backbiting.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span></p>

<p>"That will do, Wilton? I don't wish to hear anything
more about that matter. Your testimony against
Shuffles, under present circumstances, is not worth the
breath you use in uttering it."</p>

<p>"I thought it was my duty to tell you, if any one
was trying to get up a mutiny."</p>

<p>"You did not think so; you are telling me this
story to revenge yourself against the third lieutenant
for his fidelity. Whether there is, or is not, any truth
in what you say, I shall take no notice of it."</p>

<p>"It is all true, sir. He did speak to me about getting
up a mutiny, locking up the professors, taking the
ship, and going round Cape Horn; and he will not
deny it."</p>

<p>"He will have no opportunity to deny it to me, for
I shall not mention the subject to him. Go to your
duty, and remember that you have injured yourself
more than Shuffles by this course."</p>

<p>Wilton hung his head, and went forward, cheated
of his revenge, and disconcerted by the rebuke he had
received.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington was quite willing to believe that
Shuffles had talked about a mutiny, while he was in
the steerage, but there was at least no present danger
of an extravagant scheme being put into operation.
He understood Shuffles perfectly; he knew that
his high office and his ambition were his only incentives
to fidelity in the discharge of his duty; but he had
fairly won his position, and he was willing to let him
stand or fall by his own merits. He was not a young
man of high moral principle, as Paul Kendall, and
Gordon, and Carnes were; but the discipline of the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
ship was certainly doing wonders for him, though it
might ultimately fail of its ends.</p>

<p>The ship came to anchor, the band was sent on
shore, and the Fourth of July holidays were ended.
On the following morning the studies were resumed,
and everything on board went on as usual. A few
days later, the ship went on a cruise to the eastward,
spending a week in each of the principal ports on the
coast. The students soon became so accustomed to
the motion of the ship, that none of them were seasick
and the recitations were regularly heard, whether
the Young America was in port or at sea.</p>

<p>When the cold weather came, stoves were put up in
the cabins and in the steerage, and the routine of the
ship was not disturbed; but Mr. Lowington dreaded
the ice and snow, and the severe weather of mid-winter,
and in November, the Young America started
on a cruise to the southward, and in the latter part of
December she was in Chesapeake Bay. In March
she returned to Brockway. By this time the crew
were all thorough seamen, and had made excellent
progress in their studies. Mr. Lowington was entirely
satisfied with the success of his experiment, and was
resolved to persevere in it.</p>

<p>The boys were in splendid discipline, and there had
not been a case of serious illness on board during the
year. Besides the six hours of study and recitation
required of the pupils per day, they were all trained
in gymnastics by Dr. Winstock, the surgeon, who had
a system of his own, and was an enthusiast on the
subject. This exercise, with the ordinary ship's duty,
kept them in excellent physical condition; and while
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
their brown faces and rosy cheeks indicated a healthy
state of the body, their forms were finely developed,
and their muscles scientifically trained.</p>

<p>Greek and Latin, German and French, with the
ordinary English branches pursued in high schools
and academies, were taught on board, and the instructors
were satisfied that the boys accomplished twice as
much as was ordinarily done in similar institutions on
shore, and without injury to the students. Everything
was done by rule, and nothing was left to the whims
and caprices of teachers and scholars. Just so much
study was done every day, and no more. There was
no sitting up nights; there were no balls and parties,
theatres and concerts, to interfere with the work; no
late suppers of escalloped oysters and lobster salads to
be eaten. Boys who had bad habits were watched,
and injurious tendencies corrected.</p>

<p>But the students enjoyed their life on shipboard.
As the vessel went from port to port, new scenes were
opened to them. Those who could be trusted were
allowed to go on shore in their off-time; and as all
their privileges depended upon their good conduct,
they were very careful to do their duty, both as students
and as seamen, cheerfully and faithfully.</p>

<p>The Young America dropped her anchor in Brockway
Harbor on the 5th of March, on her return from
her southern cruise. The first term of the second
year was to commence on the 1st of April, and it was
understood that the ship would sail for Europe on the
last day of March. The vessel needed some repairs,
and all the students were allowed a furlough of twenty
days to visit their homes.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span></p>

<p>Several of the larger boys, including Carnes, had
obtained places in the navy, and were not to return.
Two or three were to enter college in the summer,
and a few were to go into mercantile houses; but
these vacancies would be more than filled by the applicants
who had been waiting months for an opportunity
to join the ship.</p>

<p>After the departure of the students, the Young
America was docked, and the necessary repairs made
upon her. She was thoroughly cleansed and painted,
and came out as good as new. Before the return of
the boys, her provisions, water, and stores, were taken
on board, and all the preparations made for a foreign
voyage. On the 25th of the month she was anchored
again at her old moorings, and in the course
of the next two days all the instructors and pupils
were in their places. There were eleven new boys.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen," said Mr. Lowington, as he
mounted his usual rostrum, "I am happy to see you
again, and to welcome you on board. Our experience
during the coming season will be much more interesting
and exciting than that of the last year. We shall
proceed immediately to Europe, and all who are worthy
of the privilege will have an opportunity to visit the
principal cities of Europe&mdash;London, Paris, Naples,
St. Petersburg. We shall go up the Baltic and up the
Mediterranean, in this or a subsequent cruise, and I
can safely promise you, not only an interesting, but a
profitable trip. In a circular I have informed your
parents and guardians of my purposes, and you are
shipped this time for a foreign voyage, with their consent
and approval."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span></p>

<p>This speech caused no little excitement among the
boys, who anticipated a great deal from the summer
voyage. It was no small thing to visit London, Paris,
and St. Petersburg, and not many boys obtain such an
opportunity.</p>

<p>"But, young gentlemen, I believe in discipline and
progress, as most of you know. I expect every student
to do his whole duty; and I wish to tell you now,
that misconduct, and failures at recitation, will bring
heavy disappointments upon you. If you do nothing
for yourselves, you need expect nothing from me. For
example, when the ship is going up the Thames, if
any one of you, or any number of you, should be guilty
of flagrant misconduct, or gross neglect of your studies,
you will see no more of the city of London than you
can see from the cross-trees, for you shall not put a
foot on shore."</p>

<p>"Rather steep," whispered one of the new comers.</p>

<p>"That's so, but he means it," replied an old student.</p>

<p>"We shall be at sea, out of sight of land, for twenty
or thirty days," continued Mr. Lowington. "We shall
encounter storms and bad weather, such as none of
you have ever seen; for in going from port to port, last
season, we were enabled to avoid all severe weather.
We shall go to sea now with no harbor before us till
we reach the other side of the Atlantic, and we must
take whatever comes. But the ship is as strong as a
ship can be built, and with good management she
would stand any gale that ever blew. Good management
includes good discipline, and every officer and
seaman must be faithful in the discharge of his duty,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
for the safety of the ship and all on board of her will
depend upon the fidelity of each individual.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, there are eleven new scholars:
they must take the vacant berths after the ship's company
is organized on the old plan. The offices will
be given out and the berths drawn by the merit roll
for January, February, and a portion of March&mdash;only
about nine weeks of term time."</p>

<p>Shuffles, who stood near the principal, looked very
much disconcerted when this announcement was made,
and whispered to Paul Kendall that it was not fair to
distribute the offices by last year's record. While the
Young America was lying at anchor in Chesapeake
Bay, in December, Shuffles, then second lieutenant,
had received a letter from his mother, in which she
had informed him that his family would visit Europe
in the following spring, and that he would leave the
ship, and form one of the party. This information
had caused him to relax his efforts as a student, and
he had fallen very low in rank. This was the reason
why the proposed distribution of offices was not
fair.</p>

<p>When Shuffles went home on his furlough of
twenty days, he had behaved so badly that his father
refused to have him form one of the party in the
trip abroad, and compelled him to return to the ship
for another year of wholesome discipline under Mr.
Lowington. Angry and indignant, Shuffles did return
and the announcement that the offices were to
be distributed by the merit roll did not add to his
equanimity.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span></p>

<p>"I will now read the record of marks," said the
principal, "and announce the officers for the next
term."</p>

<p>The boys were silent and anxious; for places in the
after cabin were more highly valued than ever, now
that the Young America was going to Europe.</p>

the succeeding three months, during which time the
ship crossed the Atlantic, and visited various European

The students mentioned in the list made the required
promise to behave themselves like gentlemen,
and faithfully discharge the duties of their several
offices, and were duly installed in their new positions
in the after cabin. Most of them had been officers
before, but all of them were higher in rank than at
any former period. Richard Carnes had been captain
four terms, for no one could get ahead of him.</p>

<p>The new captain had been first lieutenant, during
the preceding year, three terms out of four, and was
certainly the best qualified student on board for the
command. He was a young man of high moral
aims, with much dignity of character and energy of
purpose.</p>

<p>The officers went to the after cabin, put on their
uniforms, and assumed their proper places. The
choice of berths in the steerage proceeded as usual,
according to the merit roll, and the petty offices were
given to the highest in rank. The new boys took the
unoccupied berths by lot. The organization of the
ship was now completed, and the students were directed
to put their berths and lockers in order. The
remainder of the day was fully occupied in preparing
for the voyage. Great quantities of ice and fresh provisions
were taken on board, and packed away in the
store rooms of the hold, and all was bustle and confusion.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning the ship was put in order
again. The vessel had been duly cleared at the custom
house, and every article required for the voyage had
been received. The boys were ordered to put on
their best suits, and at nine o'clock a steamer came
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
off, having on board a large number of the parents
and friends of the students. The forenoon was given
up to this interesting occasion. It was a beautiful
day, with a gentle breeze from the westward, and at
twelve o'clock, all hands were mustered on deck for
religious services, to be performed by the chaplain, in
the presence of the friends of the pupils.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington was a religious man, and the position
of the Rev. Mr. Agneau, as chaplain on board,
was by no means a sinecure. Services had always
been held twice a day on Sunday. At five minutes
before eight in the morning, and at the same time in
the evening, prayers were said on deck, or in the
steerage, in the presence of the entire ship's company.
On the point of leaving the shores of the United
States, it seemed highly appropriate to invoke the
blessing of God on the voyage and the voyagers, and
the principal had directed that the service should be
conducted in the presence of the parents and friends.</p>

<p>The prayer and the remarks of the chaplain were
very solemn and impressive, and even the roughest of
the students were moved by them. At the conclusion
of the religious service, Mr. Lowington addressed the
visitors, explaining the details of his plan more fully
than he had done in his circulars, and saying what he
could to inspire the parents with confidence in regard
to the safety of their sons. It need not be said that
there were many tears shed on this occasion.</p>

<p>At the close of the speech a collation was served
to the visitors, in the cabins and steerage, after which
another hour was allowed for social intercourse; and
then the ship was cleared, the visitors going on board
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
the steamer again, which was to accompany the Young
America below the lighthouse. The boys were sent
below to change their clothes again.</p>

<p>"All hands, up anchor, ahoy!" piped the boatswain;
and the crew sprang to their stations with
more than usual alacrity.</p>

<p>This was a greater event than they had ever known
before. The anchor, which was now to be hauled up,
was not to be dropped again for about a month, and
then in foreign waters. They were going out upon
the waste of the ocean, to be driven and tossed by the
storms of the Atlantic. They were bidding farewell
to their native land, not again to look upon its shores
for many months. They were boys, and they were
deeply impressed by the fact.</p>

<p>The capstan was manned, and the cable hove up to
a short stay. The topsails and top-gallant sails were
set; then the anchor was hauled up to the hawse-hole,
catted and fished. The Young America moved;
she wore round, and her long voyage was commenced.
The courses and the royals were set, and she moved
majestically down the bay. The steamer kept close
by her, and salutations by shouts, cheers, and the
waving of handkerchiefs, were continually interchanged,
till the ship was several miles outside of
the lower light.</p>

<p>The steamer whistled several times, to indicate that
she was about to return. All hands were then ordered
into the rigging of the ship; and cheer after cheer was
given by the boys, and acknowledged by cheers on
the part of the gentlemen, and the waving of handkerchiefs
by the ladies. The steamer came about; the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
moment of parting had come, and she was headed
towards the city. Some of the students wept then;
for, whatever charms there were in the voyage before
them, the ties of home and friends were still strong.
As long as the steamer could be seen, signals continued
to pass between her and the ship.</p>

<p>"Captain Gordon, has the first master given the
quartermaster the course yet?" asked Mr. Lowington,
when the steamer had disappeared among the islands
of the bay.</p>

<p>"No, sir; but Mr. Fluxion told him to make it
east-north-east."</p>

<p>"Very well; but the masters should do this duty,"
added Mr. Lowington, as he directed the instructor in
mathematics to require the masters, to whom belonged
the navigation of the ship, to indicate the course.</p>

<p>William Foster was called, and sent into the after
cabin with his associates, to obtain the necessary sailing
directions. The masters had been furnished with
a supply of charts, which they had studied daily, as
they were instructed in the theory of laying down the
ship's course. Foster unrolled the large chart of the
North Atlantic Ocean upon the dinner table, and with
parallel ruler, pencil, and compasses, proceeded to
perform his duty.</p>

<p>"We want to go just south of Cape Sable," said he,
placing his pencil point on that part of the chart.</p>

<p>"How far south of it?" asked Harry Martyn.</p>

<p>"Say twenty nautical miles."</p>

<p>The first master dotted the point twenty miles south
of Cape Sable, which is the southern point of Nova
Scotia, and also the ship's position, with his pencil.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
He then placed one edge of the parallel ruler on both
of these points, thus connecting them with a straight
line.</p>

<p>A parallel ruler consists of two smaller rulers, each
an inch in width and a foot in length, connected
together by two flat pieces of brass, riveted into each
ruler, acting as a kind of hinge. The parts, when
separated, are always parallel to each other.</p>

<p>Foster placed the edge of the ruler on the two
points made with the pencil, one indicating the ship's
present position, the other the position she was to
obtain after sailing two or three days. Putting the
fingers of his left hand on the brass knob of the ruler,
by which the parts are moved, he pressed down and
held its upper half, joining the two points, firmly in
its place. With the fingers of the right hand he
moved the lower half down, which, in its turn, he kept
firmly in place, while he slipped the upper half over
the paper, thus preserving the direction between the
points. By this process the parallel ruler could be
moved all over the chart without losing the course
from one point to the other.</p>

<p>On every chart there are one or more diagrams of
the compass, with lines diverging from a centre, representing
all the points. The parallel ruler is worked
over the chart to one of these diagrams, where the
direction to which it has been set nearly or exactly
coincides with one of the lines representing a point of
the compass.</p>

<p>The first master of the Young America worked the
ruler down to a diagram, and found that it coincided
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
with the line indicating east by north; or one point
north of east.</p>

<p>"That's the course," said Thomas Ellis, the third
master&mdash;"east by north."</p>

<p>"I think not," added Foster. "If we steer that
course, we should go forty or fifty miles south of Cape
Sable, and thus run much farther than we need.
What is the variation?"</p>

<p>"About twelve degrees west," replied Martyn.</p>

<p>The compass does not indicate the true north in all
parts of the earth, the needle varying in the North
Atlantic Ocean from thirty degrees east to nearly
thirty degrees west. There is an imaginary line, extending
in a north-westerly direction, through a point
in the vicinity of Cape Lookout, called the magnetic
meridian, on which there is no variation. East of this
line the needle varies to the westward; and west of
the line, to the eastward. These variations of the
compass are marked on the chart, in different latitudes
and longitudes, though they need to be occasionally
corrected by observations, for they change slightly
from year to year.</p>

<p>"Variation of twelve degrees,"
<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
 repeated Foster,
verifying the statement by an examination of the
chart. That is equal to about one point, which, carried
to the westward from east by north, will give the
course east-north-east.</p>

<p>The process was repeated, and the same result
being obtained, the first master reported the course to
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
Mr. Fluxion, who had made the calculation himself,
in the professors' cabin.</p>

<p>"Quartermaster, make the course east-north-east,"
said the first master, when his work had been duly
approved by the instructor.</p>

<p>"East-north-east, sir!" replied the quartermaster,
who was conning the wheel&mdash;that is, he was watching
the compass, and seeing that the two wheelmen
kept the ship on her course.</p>

<p>There were two other compasses on deck, one on
the quarter-deck, and another forward of the mainmast
which the officers on duty were required frequently
to consult, in order that any negligence in one
place might be discovered in another. The after
cabin and the professors' cabin were also provided
with "tell-tales," which are inverted compasses, suspended
under the skylights, by which the officers and
instructors below could observe the ship's course.</p>

<p>The log indicated that the ship was making six
knots an hour, the rate being ascertained every two
hours, and entered on the log-slate, to be used in
making up the "dead reckoning." The Young
America had taken her "departure," that is, left the
last land to be seen, at half past three o'clock. At
four, when the log was heaved, she had made
three miles; at six, fifteen miles; at eight, the wind
diminishing and the log indicating but four knots,
only eight miles were to be added for the two hours'
run, making twenty-three miles in all. The first sea
day would end at twelve o'clock on the morrow, when
the log-slate would indicate the total of nautical miles
the ship had run after taking her departure. This is
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
called her dead reckoning, which may be measured
off on the chart, and should carry the vessel to the
point indicated by the observations for latitude and
longitude.</p>

<p>The wind was very light, and studding-sails were
set alow and aloft. The ship only made her six knots
as she pitched gently in the long swell of the ocean.
The boys were still nominally under the order of "all
hands on deck," but there was nothing for them to do,
with the exception of the wheelmen, and they were
gazing at the receding land behind them. They were
taking their last view of the shores of their native
land. Doubtless some of them were inclined to be
sentimental, but most of them were thinking of the
pleasant sights they were to see, and the exciting scenes
in which they were to engage on the other side of the
rolling ocean, and were as jolly as though earth had
no sorrows for them.</p>

<p>The principal and the professors were pacing the
quarter-deck, and doubtless some of them were wondering
whether boys like the crew of the Young
America could be induced to study and recite their
lessons amid the excitement of crossing the Atlantic,
and the din of the great commercial cities of the old
world. The teachers were energetic men, and they
were hopeful, at least, especially as study and discipline
were the principal elements of the voyage, and
each pupil's privileges were to depend upon his diligence
and his good behavior. It would be almost
impossible for a boy who wanted to go to Paris while
the ship was lying at Havre, so far to neglect his
duties as to forfeit the privilege of going. As these
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
gentlemen have not been formally introduced, the
"faculty" of the ship is here presented:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Robert Lowington, <i>Principal</i>.<br />
Rev. Thomas Agneau, <i>Chaplain</i>.<br />
Dr. Edward B. Winstock, <i>Surgeon</i>.<br />
<br />
INSTRUCTORS.<br />
<br />
John Paradyme, A.M., <i>Greek and Latin</i>.<br />
Richard Modelle, <i>Reading and Grammar</i>.<br />
Charles C. Mapps, A.M., <i>Geography and History</i>.<br />
James E. Fluxion, <i>Mathematics</i>.<br />
Abraham Carboy, M.D., <i>Chemistry and Nat. Phil.</i><br />
Adolph Badois, <i>French and German</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>These gentlemen were all highly accomplished teachers
in their several departments, as the progress of the
students during the preceding year fully proved. They
were interested in their work, and in sympathy with
the boys, as well as with the principal.</p>

<p>It was a very quiet time on board, and the crew
were collected in little groups, generally talking of the
sights they were to see. In the waist were Shuffles,
Monroe, and Wilton, all feuds among them having
been healed. They appeared to be the best of friends,
and it looked ominous for the discipline of the ship to
see them reunited. Shuffles was powerful for good
or evil, as he chose, and Mr. Lowington regretted that
he had fallen from his high position, fearing that the
self-respect which had sustained him as an officer
would desert him as a seaman, and permit him to fall
into excesses.</p>

<p>Shuffles was more dissatisfied and discontented than
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
he had ever been before. He had desired to make the
tour of Europe with his father, and he was sorely disappointed
when denied this privilege; for with the
family he would be free from restraint, and free from
hard study. When he lost his rank as an officer, he
became desperate and reckless. To live in the steerage
and do seaman's duty for three months, after he
had enjoyed the luxuries of authority, and of a state-room
in the after cabin, were intolerable. After the
cabin offices had been distributed, he told Monroe that
he intended to run away that night; but he had found
no opportunity to do so; and it was unfortunate for
his shipmates that he did not.</p>

<p>"This isn't bad&mdash;is it, Shuffles?" said Wilton, as
the ship slowly ploughed her way through the billows.</p>

<p>"I think it is. I had made up my mouth to cross
the ocean in a steamer, and live high in London and
Paris," replied Shuffles. "I don't relish this thing,
now."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Wilton.</p>

<p>"I don't feel at home here."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Because you never were anywhere else. I ought
to be captain of this ship."</p>

<p>"Well, you can be, if you have a mind to work for
it," added Monroe.</p>

<p>"Work for it! That's played out. I must stay in
the steerage three months, at any rate; and that while
the burden of the fun is going on. If we were going
to lie in harbor, or cruise along the coast, I would go
in for my old place."</p>

<p>"But Carnes is out of the way now, and your
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
chance is better this year than it was last," suggested
Monroe.</p>

<p>"I know that, but I can't think of straining every
nerve for three months, two of them while we are
going from port to port in Europe. When we go
ashore at Queenstown, I shall have to wear a short
jacket, instead of the frock coat of an officer; and I
think the jacket would look better on some younger
fellow."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Shuffles?" asked
Wilton.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be a king among hogs, than a hog
among kings."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"No matter; there's time enough to talk over these
things."</p>

<p>"Do you mean a mutiny?" laughed Wilton.</p>

<p>"Haven't you forgotten that?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I wonder what Lowington would say, if he knew
I had proposed such a thing," added Shuffles, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He did know it, at the time you captured the runaways,
for I told him."</p>

<p>"Did you?" demanded Shuffles, his brow contracting
with anger.</p>

<p>"I told you I would tell him, and I did," answered
Wilton. "You were a traitor to our fellows, and
got us into a scrape."</p>

<p>"I was an officer then."</p>

<p>"No matter for that. Do you suppose, if I were an
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
officer, I would throw myself in your way when you
were up to anything?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you would or not; but I
wouldn't blow on you, if you had told me anything in
confidence. What did Lowington say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; he wouldn't take any notice of what I
said."</p>

<p>"That was sensible on his part. One thing is certain,
Wilton: you can't be trusted."</p>

<p>"You mustn't make me mad, then."</p>

<p>"I will keep things to myself hereafter," growled
Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Don't be savage. You served me a mean trick,
and I paid you off for it; so we are square."</p>

<p>"We will keep square then, and not open any new
accounts."</p>

<p>"But you will want me when anything is up,"
laughed Wilton. "What would you do without me
in getting up a mutiny?"</p>

<p>"Who said anything about a mutiny?"</p>

<p>"I know you are thinking over something, and you
don't mean to submit to the discipline of the ship, if
you can help it."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help it."</p>

<p>"There goes the boatswain's whistle, piping to
muster," said Monroe.</p>

<p>"Confound the boatswain's whistle!" growled
Shuffles. "I don't like the idea of running every
time he pipes."</p>

<p>Very much to the surprise of his companions,
Shuffles, his irritation increased by the conduct of
Wilton, took no notice of the call, and went forward,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
instead of aft. His companions, more wise and prudent,
walked up to the hatch, which Mr. Lowington
had just mounted.</p>

<p>"Groom, tell Shuffles to come aft," said the principal
to one of the midshipmen.</p>

<p>The officer obeyed the order; Shuffles flatly refused
to go aft. Mr. Lowington descended from his rostrum
and went forward to enforce obedience. This
event created a profound sensation among the students.</p>

<p>"Shuffles," said Mr Lowington, sternly.</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the malcontent, in a surly tone.</p>

<p>"The boatswain piped the crew to muster."</p>

<p>"I heard him."</p>

<p>"You did not obey the call. I sent for you, and
you refused to come."</p>

<p>"I don't think I ought to obey the boatswain's call."</p>

<p>"May I ask why not?"</p>

<p>"I've been an officer three terms, and I should be
now if we had had fair play," growled Shuffles.</p>

<p>"I am not disposed to argue this point in your present
frame of mind. I order you to go aft."</p>

<p>"And I won't go!" replied Shuffles, impudently.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peaks," said the principal, calling the senior
boatswain.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," replied Peaks, touching his hat to the
principal.</p>

<p>"Mr. Leech," added Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>"Here, sir."</p>

<p>"Walk this young gentleman aft."</p>

<p>"Let me alone!" cried Shuffles, as Peaks placed
his hand upon him.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span></p>

<p>"Gently, my sweet lamb," said the boatswain, with
affected tenderness.</p>

<p>"Take your hands off me!" roared the mutinous
pupil, as he struggled to release himself from the grasp
of the stalwart seaman.</p>

<p>Peaks took him by the collar with one hand, and
held his wrist with the other, on one side, while Leech
did the same on the other side.</p>

<p>"Walk him aft," repeated the principal.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fluxion, may I trouble you to bring up the
irons?" continued Mr. Lowington, when the boatswain
and carpenter had "walked" the rebel aft, in
spite of his struggling and kicking.</p>

<p>"Irons!" gasped Shuffles, as he heard the request
of the principal.</p>

<p>He trembled with rage as he uttered the word. The
irons seemed to pierce his soul. Probably he did not
think that the son of a wealthy gentleman would be
compelled to submit to such an indignity as being put
in irons.</p>

<p>Mr. Fluxion came on deck with a pair of handcuffs.
It was the first time they had been seen, and no student
even knew there were any on board. The discipline
of the ship had been as gentle as it was firm, and this
was the first time such instruments were necessary.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peaks, put the irons on him!" said Mr.
Lowington, his usual dignity unruffled by angry emotions.</p>

<p>"Don't put them on me!" cried Shuffles, making
an effort to disengage himself from the grasp of his
captors.</p>

<p>"Put them on at once!" added the principal.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span></p>

<p>"You shall not put them on me! I will die first!"
roared the rebel.</p>

<p>It was easier to talk than to do, in the hands of two
sturdy sailors, one of whom had used the cat in the
navy, when its use was tolerated. Shuffles did not
die, and he was ironed, in spite of his struggles and
his protest.</p>

<h4>THE WATCH-BILL.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>Shuffles struggled with the irons and with the
stout men who held him until he had exhausted
himself; and then, because his frame, rather than his
spirit, was worn down, he was quiet. It was the first
case of severe discipline that had occurred on board,
and it created a tremendous sensation among the
students.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington stood with folded arms, watching
the vain struggles of the culprit, until he was reduced
to a state of comparative calmness. He looked sad,
rather than angry, and his dignity was not impaired
by the assault upon his authority.</p>

<p>"Shuffles, I am sorry to see one who has been an
officer of the ship reduced to your condition; but
discipline must and shall be maintained," said the
principal. "We are on the high seas now, and disobedience
is dangerous. You led me to believe that
you had reformed your life and conduct."</p>

<p>"It isn't my fault," replied Shuffles, angrily.</p>

<p>"You had better not reply to me in that tone,"
added Mr. Lowington, mildly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Topliffe," continued the principal.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, sir," replied the head steward.</p>

<p>"You will have the brig cleared out for use."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir;" and the head steward went below to
obey the order.</p>

<p>There was not a boy on board who knew what the
"brig" was, though the establishment had existed in
the steerage from the time when the boys first went on
board the ship. It had never before been required for
use, and Mr. Lowington had carefully veiled every
disagreeable feature of discipline, until it was necessary
to exhibit it. The brig was the prison of the ship&mdash;the
lock-up. It was located under and abaft the main
ladder, in the steerage, being an apartment five feet in
length by three feet in width. The partitions which
enclosed it were composed of upright planks, eight
inches in width, with spaces between them for the
admission of light and air.</p>

<p>The brig had been used as a store room for bedding
by the stewards, and the students never suspected,
till Shuffles' case came up, that it was not built for
a closet. Mr. Topliffe and his assistants removed
the blankets and comforters from this lock-up, and
prepared it for the reception of the refractory pupil.
When the room was ready he went on deck, and
reported the fact to the principal.</p>

<p>"Shuffles, our discipline has always been of the
mildest character," said Mr. Lowington, breaking the
impressive silence which reigned on deck. "I regret
to be compelled to resort to force in any form; even
now I would avoid it."</p>

<p>"You needn't, on my account," replied Shuffles,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
shaking his head. "You have done your worst
already."</p>

<p>"Mr. Peaks, take him below, lock him up in the
brig, and bring the key to me."</p>

<p>The manacled rebel made another effort to resist,
but the stout sailors easily handled him, and bore him
down into the steerage. He was thrust into the
brig, ironed as he was, and the door locked upon
him. Shuffles glanced at the interior of the prison,
and broke out into a contemptuous laugh. He then
commenced kicking the pales of the partition? but
he might as well have attempted to break through the
deck beneath.</p>

<p>"Shuffles," said Peaks, in a low tone, when he had
locked the door, "be a man. You act like a spoiled
child now."</p>

<p>"I have been insulted, and abused," replied Shuffles,
fiercely.</p>

<p>"No, you haven't. Aboard almost any ship, you
would have got a knock on the head with a handspike
before this time. Don't make a fool of yourself. You
are only making yourself ridiculous now&mdash;'pon my
word as an old sailor, you are."</p>

<p>"I'll have satisfaction."</p>

<p>"No, you won't, unless you break your own head.
I want to advise you, as a friend, not to make a fool
of yourself. I'm sorry for you, my lad."</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me."</p>

<p>"I can forgive you for disobeying orders, but I can't
forgive you for being a fool. Now, keep quiet, and be
a man."</p>

<p>The well-meant effort of the boatswain to pacify the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
culprit was a failure, and Peaks, going on deck, delivered
the key of the brig to Mr. Lowington. Shuffles
kicked against the partition till he was tired of the
exercise.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, to-day we enter upon a new
experience on shipboard," said the principal, without
making any further allusion to Shuffles. "Our short
trips last season were so timed that we kept no regular
night watches, and, with two or three exceptions, the
ship was at anchor when you slept. Of course that is
not practicable on a long voyage, and you must all do
duty by night as well as by day.</p>

<p>"This has been a difficult matter to arrange, for you
are all too young to be deprived of your regular sleep,
though in heavy weather I am afraid you will lose
your rest to some extent. At eight o'clock this evening
the starboard watch will be on duty. We have four
times as many hands on board the Young America as
are usually employed in merchant ships, so that a
quarter watch will be able to handle the ship on all
ordinary occasions. We shall, therefore, keep a quarter
watch on ship's duty at all times through the
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>"During the night, including the time from eight in
the evening until eight in the morning, each quarter
watch will be on duty two hours, and then off six
hours; and each hand will obtain six consecutive
hours' sleep every night. At eight this evening, the
first part of the starboard watch will have the ship in
charge, and all others may turn in and sleep. At ten,
the second part of the starboard watch will be called,
without disturbing any others. At twelve, the first
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
part of the port watch will be summoned; at two, the
second part; and so on till eight in the morning.</p>

<p>"The first part of the starboard watch, which turned
in at ten, will sleep till four, giving them six hours of
rest all together, and they may turn in again at six
o'clock, when relieved by the second part, and sleep
till half past seven, which is breakfast time for those
off duty.</p>

<p>"During the daytime, from eight in the morning
till eight in the evening, the same routine will be observed
To-morrow, at eight in the morning, the
first part of the port watch will take charge of the
ship till ten; the second part will be off duty, and the
time will be their own, to use as they think proper.
At ten, the second part will be in charge, and the first
will have their own time till twelve. All the starboard
watch, during these four hours, will study and recite.
In the afternoon the same course will be pursued with
the other watch. Do you understand it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the boys.</p>

<p>"By this arrangement you will average three hours
of duty every night. To-night the port watch will
be on deck two hours, and the starboard watch, whose
turn will come twice, four hours; but to-morrow night
the operation will be reversed, and the port will
have the deck four hours, and the starboard but two.
Two copies of the watch bill will be posted in the
steerage, and one in the after cabin. Young gentlemen,
I recommend you to study it, until you are perfectly
familiar with its requirements."</p>

<p>"How is it with the officers, Mr. Lowington?"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
asked Paul Kendall, who was generally the spokesman
for his companions.</p>

<p>"The officers are divided into watches in precisely
the same manner as the crew. To the starboard watch
belong the first and third lieutenant, the second and
fourth master, and the first and third midshipman,
which makes one officer of each grade for each quarter
watch," replied Mr. Lowington. "Their off-time
and study-time correspond with those of the crew."</p>

<p>It is quite possible that the officers and crew of the
Young America understood the complicated arrangement
of the principal. If they did not, they could
refer to the posted document; and, as we cannot deprive
our readers of this privilege, we insert in full,

<p>The watch bill for the second day was the same,
with the exception of the names of the watches and
quarter watches. The entire programme was reversed
by the operation of the dog watches, which substituted
"port" for "starboard," and "starboard" for "port,"
in the next day's routine.</p>

<p>When the boys were permitted to go below, they
rushed to the watch bills, and studied them faithfully,
till they fully understood the programme. Each
student ascertained his duty for the night, and his
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
off-time and study-hours for the next day, which were
included in the first day's bill.</p>

<p>"I go on at twelve o'clock," said Paul Kendall, in
the after cabin, when he had examined the bill.</p>

<p>"And I go on deck at eight o'clock," added Joseph
Haven, the first lieutenant. "I shall have a chance
to sleep from ten till four in the morning, and an hour
and a half, from six till half past seven."</p>

<p>"I shall have my watch below from two till breakfast
time. I don't think we need wear ourselves out
under this arrangement."</p>

<p>"No; I thought we should be obliged to take four
hours of duty at a time on deck."</p>

<p>"How will it be when we have rough weather?"
asked Paul.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I suppose we must take our chances
then."</p>

<p>"What do you think of Shuffles' case?" added
Paul.</p>

<p>"He will get the worst of it."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for him. He behaved first rate last
year, though they say he used to be a hard fellow."</p>

<p>"What's the use of a fellow doing as he has done?"
said Haven, with palpable disgust. "He can't make
anything by it."</p>

<p>"Of course he can't."</p>

<p>"I would rather have him in the cabin than in the
steerage, for he will not obey orders; and when he is
ugly, he is a perfect tiger. I wonder what Mr. Lowington
is going to do with him. There is no such
thing as expelling a fellow in this institution now. If
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
he means to be cross-grained, he can keep us in hot
water all the time."</p>

<p>The officers were too much excited by the fact that
the ship was outward bound to remain long in the
cabin, and they returned to the deck to watch the
progress of the vessel. At eight o'clock the Young
America was out of sight of land, though it would
have been too dark to see it ten miles distant. The
quartermaster, at the helm, struck eight bells, which
were repeated on the forecastle.</p>

<p>"All the first part of the starboard watch, ahoy!"
shouted the boatswain, for it was now time to commence
the programme of regular sea duty.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant took his place, as officer of the
deck, near the helm; the second master on the forecastle
and the third midshipman in the waist. The
first part of the starboard watch were stationed in
various parts of the deck. Of the four quartermasters,
one was attached to each quarter watch. The wheel
was given to two hands for the first hour, and two
were placed on the top-gallant forecastle, to act as the
lookout men, to be relieved after one hour's service.
The rest of the boys were required to keep awake, but
no special duty was assigned to them. There were
hands enough on deck to "tack ship," or to take in
the sails, one or two at a time.</p>

<p>Though the ship was nominally in the hands and
under the direction of her juvenile officers, who performed
all the duties required in working her, yet
they were closely watched by the principal, who, if
there was anything wrong, informed the captain of
the fact. The commander kept no watch, but he was
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
responsible for every manoeuvre, and for the regular
routine of duty. Mr. Lowington seldom spoke to
any other officer in regard to ship's duty or the navigation.</p>

<p>When the watch was set, at eight bells, most of the
boys who were off duty went into the steerage. Some
of them turned in; but the novelty of the occasion
was too great to permit them to sleep. They collected
in groups, to talk over the prospects of the voyage, and
the duties required of them, as indicated by the watch
bill.</p>

<p>Shuffles sat on a stool in the brig, still nursing
his wrath. When his supper was carried to him by
the steward, his irons had been taken off. He refused
to eat, and the food was removed. As he was now
quiet, the irons were not replaced. The prisoner was
far from penitent for his offence.</p>

<p>Mr. Agneau, the chaplain, was very much concerned
about the prisoner. He was shocked by his
disobedience, and pained to find that one who had
done so well could do so ill. The case had been fully
considered in the professors' cabin; and Mr. Lowington
declared that Shuffles should stay in the brig
till he had repented of his folly, and promised obedience
for the future. The chaplain was a tender-hearted
man, and he thought that some gentle words
might touch the feelings of the prisoner, and bring
him to a sense of duty. With the principal's permission,
therefore, he paid a visit to Shuffles in the
evening.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to find you here, Shuffles," said
Mr. Agneau, when he had locked the door behind him.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span></p>

<p>"Has Lowington sent you to torment me?" demanded
the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lowington, you mean," added the chaplain,
gently.</p>

<p>"No, I mean Lowington. When a man has abused
and insulted me, I can't stop to put a handle to his
name."</p>

<p>"I regret to find you in such an unhappy frame of
mind, my young friend. I came here of my own
accord, to do what I might to help you."</p>

<p>"Did you, indeed!" sneered Shuffles.</p>

<p>"That was my only object."</p>

<p>"Was it? Well, if you want to help me, you will
induce Lowington to let me out of this crib, apologize
for what he has done, and give me my place in the
after cabin."</p>

<p>"That is plainly impossible," replied the astonished
chaplain.</p>

<p>"Then you can't do anything for me; and I think I
can take care of myself."</p>

<p>"I entreat you, my young friend, to consider the
error of your ways."</p>

<p>"There is no error in my ways, Mr. Agneau."</p>

<p>"You are unreasonable."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. I only want what is fair and right."</p>

<p>"Was it right for you, Shuffles, to refuse obedience
to the principal, when he told you to go aft?"</p>

<p>"I have always obeyed all proper orders; and
under the circumstances, I think it was right for me
to refuse."</p>

<p>"You fill me with amazement!" exclaimed the
chaplain.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span></p>

<p>"You know it was not fair to give out the offices by
last year's marks," protested Shuffles.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I think it was entirely fair."</p>

<p>"I haven't anything more to say if it was," replied
Shuffles, in surly tones.</p>

<p>The chaplain, finding the prisoner was not in a
proper frame of mind for edifying conversation,
left him, and returned to the professors' cabin. The
boys had been forbidden to go near the brig, or to
speak to the prisoner; and thus far no one had exhibited
any disposition to disregard the order. Many
of them, as they passed near the brig, glanced curiously
at him. After the departure of the chaplain, Wilton
sat down on a stool near the lock-up.</p>

<p>"How are you. Shuffles?" said he, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Come here, Wilton&mdash;will you?" replied the
prisoner.</p>

<p>"I can't; we are not allowed to speak to you."</p>

<p>"What do you care for that? No one can see you."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I want to talk with you."</p>

<p>"I shall be punished if I'm caught."</p>

<p>"You won't be caught. How are our fellows
now?"</p>

<p>"First rate," replied Wilton, walking up and down
the berth deck, rising and looking as though nothing
was going on.</p>

<p>"You know what we were talking about just before
the row," added Shuffles, drawing his stool up to the
palings.</p>

<p>"You said you wouldn't trust me," answered Wilton,
still pacing the deck in front of the brig.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span></p>

<p>"You told Lowington about something he had no
business to know; but I forgive you, Wilton."</p>

<p>"You are very willing to forgive me, now you are
in a tight place."</p>

<p>"It was mean of you to do it, Wilton; you can't
deny that. Lowington was on the best of terms with
me when I was in the after cabin, and I might have
told him a hundred things about you."</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell him anything?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"Well, you are a good fellow, and I always thought
you were. I couldn't see why you turned traitor to
us when we intended to spend the Fourth of July on
shore."</p>

<p>"I was obliged to do what I did. If I hadn't, I
should have been turned out of my office."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you were right, Shuffles, and we won't
say anything more about the past," replied Wilton,
who was too willing to be on good terms with the
powerful malcontent, even while he was a prisoner
and in disgrace.</p>

<p>"Wilton, I am going to be captain of this ship
within ten days," said Shuffles, in a whisper. "Now
you may go and tell Lowington of that."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall not tell him," added Wilton,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"I told you merely to show you that I had full confidence
in you&mdash;that's all. You can betray me if
you wish to do so."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to do anything of the kind. Of
course we shall always go together, as we did before
you were an officer."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall be an officer again soon."</p>

<p>"What's the use of talking about such a thing?"</p>

<p>"I shall."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to get up the mutiny?"</p>

<p>"I do. I feel more like it now than I ever did
before," replied Shuffles; and his low tones came
from between his closed teeth.</p>

<p>"It's no use to think of such a thing. It's too
wild."</p>

<p>"No matter if it is; it shall be carried out."</p>

<p>"The fellows won't go in for it; they won't dare to
do it."</p>

<p>"Yes, they will. I know them better than you do,
Wilton. It isn't quite time yet; but in three or four
days they will be ready for anything."</p>

<p>"You can't bring them up to what you mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can."</p>

<p>"What do you expect to do, locked up in that
place?" demanded Wilton, incredulously.</p>

<p>"When I get ready to go out of this place, I shall
go. I needn't stay here any longer than I please."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean to get up a mutiny?"</p>

<p>"Hush! Don't call it by that name."</p>

<p>"What shall I call it?"</p>

<p>"Call it making a chain."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," answered Wilton, puzzled
by the expression.</p>

<p>"I know what I'm about, and I have got more
friends in the ship than Lowington has. And I know
exactly how to manage the whole thing," added Shuffles,
confidently.</p>

<p>"But the fellows are all perfectly satisfied with their
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
condition. They wish to go to Europe, and are pleased
with the prospect before them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are; and they shall all go to Europe,
and travel about without being tied to Lowington's
coat-tails. I shall come out of this place to-morrow,
and we will work the thing up."</p>

<p>"I'm in for a time with any good fellow; but I
don't think we can make this thing go," said Wilton.
"Hush! Don't say another word. There comes an
officer."</p>

<p>One bell, indicating half past eight in the evening,
struck on deck. It was the duty of the master and
midshipman on deck, alternately, to pass through the
steerage every half hour during the watch, to see that
there was no disorder, and that the lights were all
secure, so as to avoid any danger from fire. Henry
Martyn, the second master, performed this office on
the present occasion. He descended the main ladder,
and Wilton, who expected the visit when he heard
the stroke of the bell, retreated to his mess room,
and threw himself into his berth. Harry walked
around the steerage, and glanced into the gangways,
from which the rooms opened.</p>

<p>"Harry," said Shuffles, in a low tone, as the master
was about to return to the deck.</p>

<p>"Did you speak to me?" asked Harry, stepping
up to the bars of the cage.</p>

<p>"I did. Will you oblige me by telling the chaplain
that I would like to see him?" added the prisoner.</p>

<p>"I will;" and Harry knocked at the door of the
professors' cabin.</p>

<h4>MAKING A CHAIN.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>The chaplain was too glad of an opportunity to
converse with the prisoner to refuse his request,
and he hastened to the brig, hoping to find Shuffles in a
better state of mind than when he had visited him
before. Mr. Agneau entered the lock-up, and was
securing the door behind him, when the prisoner
spoke.</p>

<p>"You needn't lock it, sir; I will not attempt to
escape," said he. "I sent for you to apologize for my
rudeness."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Then I am very glad to see you," replied
the delighted chaplain. "I have been sorely grieved
at your misconduct, and I would fain have brought
you to see the error of your ways."</p>

<p>"I see it now, sir," replied Shuffles, with apparent
penitence. "I'm afraid I am a great deal worse
than you think I am, sir."</p>

<p>"It is of no consequence what I think, Shuffles, if
you are conscious of the wrong you have done,"
added the worthy chaplain. "You behaved exceedingly
well last year, and it almost broke my heart to
see you relapsing into your former evil habits."</p>

<p>"I am grateful to you for the interest you have
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
taken in me, and I assure you I have often been encouraged
to do well by your kind words," continued
the penitent, with due humility. "I have done wrong,
and I don't deserve to be forgiven."</p>

<p>"'He that humbleth himself shall be exalted,'" said
Mr. Agneau, gratified at the great change which had
apparently been wrought in the prisoner. "If you
are really sorry for your offence, Mr. Lowington, I
doubt not, will pardon you, and restore you to favor
again."</p>

<p>"I don't deserve it, sir. Since you left me, I have
been thinking of my past life. I dare not tell you
how bad I have been."</p>

<p>"You need not tell me. It is not necessary that
you should confess your errors to me. There is One
who knows them, and if you are sincerely repentant
He will pity and forgive you."</p>

<p>"I think I should feel better if I told some one of
my misdeeds."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would; that is for you to judge. I
will speak to Mr. Lowington about you to-night.
What shall I say to him?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know. I deserve to be punished. I have
done wrong, and am willing to suffer for it."</p>

<p>The tender-hearted chaplain thought that Shuffles
was in a beautiful state of mind, and he desired to
have him released at once, that he might converse
with him on great themes under more favorable circumstances;
but Shuffles still detained him.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I have ruined myself on board this
ship," continued Shuffles, persisting in his self-humiliation.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span></p>

<p>"If you manfully acknowledge your fault, you will
be freely and generously forgiven."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lowington hates me now, after what I have
done."</p>

<p>"O, far from it!" exclaimed the chaplain. "It
will be a greater satisfaction to him than to you to forgive
you. You are no longer of the opinion that you
were unfairly used in the distribution of the offices, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Mr. Agneau, I was beside myself when I resisted
the principal. I should not have done it if I had been
in my right mind."</p>

<p>"You were very angry."</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;I was not myself."</p>

<p>"Anger often makes men crazy."</p>

<p>"You don't understand me, Mr. Agneau."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do. You mean that you deluded yourself
into the belief that you had been wronged, and
that you ought not to obey the orders of your officers,
and of the principal. The force that was used made
you so angry that you did not know what you were
about," added the sympathizing chaplain.</p>

<p>"In one word, Mr. Agneau, I had been drinking,"
said Shuffles, with something like desperation in his
manner, as he bent his head, and covered his face
with his hands.</p>

<p>"Drinking!" gasped the chaplain, filled with horror
at the confession.</p>

<p>"I told you I was worse than you thought I was,"
moaned Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Is it possible!"</p>

<p>"It is true, sir; I say it with shame."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you in the habit of taking intoxicating
drinks?" asked the chaplain, confounded beyond
measure at this complication of the difficulty.</p>

<p>"I am not in the habit of it, because I can't get
liquor all the time. My father has wine on his table,
and I always was allowed to drink one glass."</p>

<p>"Can it be!" ejaculated the chaplain. "A youth
of seventeen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm eighteen now, sir."</p>

<p>"A youth of eighteen in the habit of taking wine!"
groaned Mr. Agneau.</p>

<p>"I drank a great deal more than my father knew
of while I was at home."</p>

<p>"I am amazed!"</p>

<p>"I knew you would be, sir; but I have told you the
truth now."</p>

<p>"But where did you get your liquor to-day?"</p>

<p>"It was wine, sir."</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I brought two bottles on board with me when I
reported for duty yesterday."</p>

<p>"This is terrible, Shuffles! Do you know what
an awful habit you are contracting, my dear young
friend?"</p>

<p>"I never thought much about it till to-night. It has
got me into such a scrape this time, that I don't believe
I shall ever drink any more."</p>

<p>"As you respect yourself, as you hope for peace in
this world, and peace in the next, never put the cup to
your lips again. 'Wine is a mocker; strong drink is
raging; and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.'
Did you drink the two bottles?"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir; only part of one bottle," replied Shuffles,
with commendable promptness.</p>

<p>"Where is the rest of it?"</p>

<p>"Under my berth-sack."</p>

<p>"Are you willing I should take possession of it, and
hand it to Mr. Lowington?"</p>

<p>"I will agree to anything which you think is
right."</p>

<p>"Then I will take the wine and throw it overboard."</p>

<p>"Just as you think best, sir. You will find the two
bottles in my berth, No. 43, Gangway D,&mdash;the forward
one on the starboard side."</p>

<p>"I hope you will never touch the wine-cup again."</p>

<p>"I will not&mdash;till next time," added Shuffles, as the
chaplain moved towards the door of the brig.</p>

<p>"'Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,
when it giveth his color in the cup, at the last it biteth
like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder,'" continued
the chaplain, as he passed out of the lock-up.</p>

<p>Mr. Agneau went to the prisoner's berth, and found
the two bottles of wine. They were a sufficient explanation
of the remarkable conduct of Shuffles. The
youth had "drank wine, and was drunken," otherwise
he would not have been guilty of such flagrant disobedience.
Though in his own estimation the excuse
was worse than the original fault, yet it was an explanation;
and if the root of the evil could be removed,
the evil itself would cease to exist. The wine could
be thrown overboard, and as no more could be obtained
during the voyage, the good conduct of the
young tippler would be insured, at least till the ship
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
reached Queenstown, which was the port to which
she was bound.</p>

<p>With the two bottles in his hands, the chaplain
returned to the professors' cabin. Mr. Lowington was
on deck. He did not deem it prudent to leave the
ship in the hands of the students, at first, without any
supervision, and it was arranged that the principal,
Mr. Fluxion, and Mr. Peake, the boatswain, should
take turns in observing the course and management of
the vessel. Mr. Agneau carried the prize he had captured
on deck, and informed Mr. Lowington what had
just transpired in the brig.</p>

<p>"I knew the boy drank wine when he was at home,"
replied the principal; "and if he is ruined, his father
must blame himself."</p>

<p>"But it is really shocking!" exclaimed the chaplain
as he tossed one of the bottles of wine over the
rail. "How can a parent permit his son to drink
wine, when he knows that more men are killed by
intemperance than by war and pestilence? I am
amazed!"</p>

<p>"So am I, Mr. Agneau."</p>

<p>"The boy is hardly to blame for his conduct, since
he contracted this vicious habit under the eye of his
father."</p>

<p>"The discipline of the ship must be preserved."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Lowington."</p>

<p>"And the boy is just as much to blame for his act
of disobedience as though it had been done in his
sober senses."</p>

<p>"But you can afford to pardon him, under the circumstances."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span></p>

<p>"I will do that when he is willing to make a proper
acknowledgment of his offence in the presence of the
ship's company, before whom the act was committed."</p>

<p>"He is quite ready to do so now."</p>

<p>"If he will say as much as that to me, he shall be
released at once."</p>

<p>"He will, sir."</p>

<p>"It is very strange to me that I noticed nothing
peculiar in the boy's speech or manner at the time,"
added the principal. "He certainly did not seem to
be intoxicated."</p>

<p>"Probably he had taken just enough to inflame his
evil passions, without affecting his manner," suggested
the chaplain.</p>

<p>"I did not even discover the odor of wine upon
him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you did not go near enough to him. If
you please, Mr. Lowington, we will go down and see
him; and you can judge for yourself whether or not
it is prudent to release him."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I feel a deep interest in the
young man, and I hope he may yet be saved."</p>

<p>When Mr. Agneau left the brig, after his second
visit, Wilton, who was very anxious to know what
Shuffles meant by "making a chain," came out of his
mess room. He had been watching the chaplain,
and wondering what the prisoner could have to say
to him.</p>

<p>"What's up, Shuffles?" asked Wilton, when Mr.
Agneau had left the steerage.</p>

<p>"I've been smoothing him down," laughed Shuffles,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
with an audible chuckle. "I have concluded not to
stay in here any longer."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming out pretty soon, though it has cost me
a bottle and a half of old sherry to get out," laughed
Shuffles.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"I told the parson that I was drunk when I disobeyed
orders, and that I was very sorry for it, and
wouldn't get drunk any more."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him that?"</p>

<p>"I did; I assured him I was the worst fellow in the
whole world, and ought to be hung, drawn, and quartered
for my wickedness; and he swallowed it as a
codfish does a clam."</p>

<p>"And you gave him all the wine?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't; I gave him one full bottle, and what
was left in the one from which we drank this afternoon.
I have two more."</p>

<p>"We were going to have a good time with that
wine."</p>

<p>"I have enough left."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"In my locker."</p>

<p>"They may find it."</p>

<p>"No, they won't; I will put it in some other place
before inspection day. There is plenty of wine in the
medical stores. It was a good joke for the parson to
suppose I was drunk."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you were," suggested Wilton.</p>

<p>"I felt good; but I was as sober as I am now."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span></p>

<p>"The drink I took went into my head, and I felt as
though I was going up in a ballon."</p>

<p>"That was because you are not used to the article.
It waked me up a little, but I knew what I was
about."</p>

<p>"I think you were a confounded fool to do what
you did."</p>

<p>"Wilton, I'm not going to live in the steerage&mdash;you
may take my word for it. I've been an officer
too long to come down to that. If we don't succeed
in making a chain, I shall quit the concern the first
time I put my foot on shore in Ireland."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by making a chain?" asked
Wilton, eagerly.</p>

<p>"A chain is strong."</p>

<p>"Well; what of it?"</p>

<p>"It is composed of many links. Can't you understand
that?"</p>

<p>"Hush up! Some one is coming," said Wilton, as
he walked away from the brig.</p>

<p>"Here! who is that?" demanded Mr. Lowington,
as he saw Wilton moving away from the lock-up.</p>

<p>"No. 59, sir&mdash;Wilton," replied he. "I was just
going on deck to find you, sir."</p>

<p>"To find me?" asked the principal.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Shuffles called me when I was passing,
and wished me to tell you he wanted to see you very
much. I was just going after you, sir."</p>

<p>"If there is any blame, sir, it rests on me," interposed
Shuffles, through the bars of his prison.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington unlocked the door of the brig, and
entered, followed by Mr. Agneau, leaving Wilton to
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
congratulate himself on the result of the lies he had
uttered.</p>

<p>"I am told you wish to see me, Shuffles," said the
principal.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I wish to say that I am extremely sorry
for what I have done."</p>

<p>"I thought you were crazy when you refused to
obey; and now I find you were."</p>

<p>"I had been drinking, sir, I confess."</p>

<p>"Mr. Agneau has told me your story; it is not
necessary to repeat it now. To-morrow I shall require
you to acknowledge your error at muster, and promise
obedience in the future. Are you willing to do so?"</p>

<p>"I am, sir."</p>

<p>"You are discharged from confinement then, and
will at once return to your duty," replied Mr. Lowington,
upon whom Shuffles did not venture to intrude
his extremely penitential story. "To which watch do
you belong?"</p>

<p>"To the port watch, first part, sir."</p>

<p>"It will be on deck during the first half of the mid
watch, from twelve till two," added the principal, as
he came out of the brig.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington made no parade of what he had
done. He never subjected any student to unnecessary
humiliation. He indulged in no reproaches, and
preached no sermons. He went on deck, intending
to leave the culprit to the influence of the better
thoughts which he hoped and believed had been
kindled in his mind by the events of the day. Mr.
Agneau remained a moment to give a final admoni
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>tion
to the penitent, as he regarded him, and then
went to his cabin.</p>

<p>"Are you going to turn in, Shuffles?" asked
Wilton.</p>

<p>"Not yet. Are there any of our fellows below?"</p>

<p>"Plenty of them."</p>

<p>"Our fellows" was a term applied to that portion
of the crew who were understood to be ready for any
scrape which might be suggested. Shuffles had coined
the expression himself, while at the Brockway Academy,
and introduced it on board the ship. Without
concealment or palliation, they were bad boys. By
the discipline of the ship they were kept in good
order, and compelled to perform their duties.</p>

<p>As in every community of men or boys, where
persons of kindred tastes find each other out, the bad
boys in the Young America had discovered those of
like tendencies, and a bond of sympathy and association
had been established among them. They knew
and were known of each other.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is equally true, that there was
a bond of sympathy and association among the good
boys, as there is among good men. If a good man
wishes to establish a daily prayer meeting, he does
not apply to the intemperate, the profane swearers, and
the Sabbath breakers of his neighborhood for help;
there is a magnetism among men which leads him to
the right persons. If a bad man intends to get up a
mob, a raffle, or a carousal, he does not seek assistance
among those who go to church every Sunday, and
refrain from evil practices, either from principle or
policy. He makes no mistakes of this kind.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span></p>

<p>In every community, perhaps one fourth of the whole
number are positively good, and one fourth positively
bad, while the remaining two fourths are more or less
good or more or less bad, floating undecided between
the two poles of the moral magnet, sometimes drawn
one way, and sometimes the other.</p>

<p>The Young America was a world in herself, and
the moral composition of her people was similar to
that of communities on a larger scale. She had all
the elements of good and evil on board. One fourth
of the students were doubtless high-minded, moral
young men, having fixed principles, and being willing
to make great sacrifices rather than do wrong. As
good behavior, as well as proficiency in the studies,
was an element of success in the ship, a large proportion
of the positively good boys were in the after
cabin.</p>

<p>Another fourth of the students were reckless and
unprincipled, with no respect for authority, except so
far as it was purchased by fear of punishment or hope
of reward. Occasionally one of this class worked his
way into the cabin by superior natural ability, and a
spasmodic attempt to better his condition on board.</p>

<p>The rest of the ship's company belonged to the
indefinite, undecided class, floating more or less distant
from the positive elements of good or evil. They were
not bad boys, for, with proper influences, they could be,
and were, kept from evil ways. They were not good
boys on principle, for they could be led away in paths
of error.</p>

<p>"Our fellows" were the positively bad boys of the
floating academy; and they existed in no greater pro
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>portion
in the ship's company than in the communities
of the great world. To this class belonged
Shuffles, Wilton, Monroe, and others. To the positively
good boys belonged Gordon, Kendall, Martyn,
and others&mdash;not all of them in the after cabin, by any
means.</p>

<p>Shuffles and Wilton walked forward to find some
of these kindred spirits. They seemed to know just
where to look for them, for they turned in at Gangway
D. Over each of the six passages from which the
mess rooms opened, a lantern was suspended, besides
four more in the middle of the steerage. It was light
enough, therefore, in the rooms for their occupants to
read coarse print.</p>

<p>In the lower berths of mess room No. 8 lay two
students, while another sat on a stool between them.
Their occupation was sufficient evidence that they
belonged to "our fellows," for they were shaking
props for money, on a stool between the bunks. As
Shuffles and Wilton approached, they picked up the
props and the stakes, and drew back into their beds.</p>

<p>"It's Shuffles," said Philip Sanborn. "How did
you get out?"</p>

<p>"Worked out," replied Shuffles, gayly.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you broke jail?"</p>

<p>"No; that would have been too much trouble.
There was an easier way, and I took that."</p>

<p>"How was it?"</p>

<p>"Why, I soft-sawdered the parson, and he soft-sawdered
Lowington."</p>

<p>"It's all right; go ahead with the game," said
Lynch, as he produced the props again.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span></p>

<p>Sanborn placed the money on the stool, consisting
of two quarters in fractional currency. Lynch shook
the props, and dropped them on the stool.</p>

<p>"A nick!" exclaimed he, snatching the money.
"I'll go you a half now."</p>

<p>"Half it is," replied Sanborn, as he placed the
requisite sum on the money the other laid down.</p>

<p>Lynch rattled the props, and threw them down
again.</p>

<p>"A browner!" cried he, intensely excited, as he
seized the money with eager hand.</p>

<p>"Don't talk so loud, you fool!" added Sanborn.
"The fellows are asleep above us, and you will wake
them up. I'll go you a half again."</p>

<p>"Half it is!" replied Lynch, in a whisper, as he
shook again.</p>

<p>"An out!" said Sanborn, picking up the money.</p>

<p>"Three bells! Dry up!" interposed Wilton. "One
of the officers of the deck will be down in a minute."</p>

<p>The young gamblers put away the implements, and
drew back into their berths until the inspecting officer
had looked into the room. When the master had gone
on deck again, the play was resumed, and Shuffles
and Wilton watched it with deep interest.</p>

<p>Gambling was a new thing on board the Young
America. It had not been practised at all in the preceding
year, having been introduced by Shuffles and
Monroe, who had visited a prop saloon in the city
where they resided, during their late furlough. Each
of them had brought a set of props on board, with
which they intended to amuse themselves during the
voyage. As yet, the practice was confined to a few
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
of "our fellows;" but the crew in the steerage were
certainly in very great danger of being carried away
by the passion for gaming, for it was spreading
rapidly.</p>

<p>The prop-shaking was carried on in the mess rooms,
while the students were off duty. Shuffles had played
with half a dozen boys the night before; Sanborn
and Lynch had been engaged in the game since the
first watch was set, and another party had been employed
in the same manner in another room. All of
the boys were supplied with money in considerable
sums, generally in sovereigns and half sovereigns, for
use when they reached Europe. It was changing
hands now, though no one had as yet been particularly
lucky.</p>

<p>"Have a game, Shuffles?" said Lynch, when Sanborn
declared that he had no money left but gold.</p>

<p>"No," replied Shuffles, "I shall not play any more."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I haven't time; and I don't want to become too
fond of it."</p>

<p>"Haven't time!" exclaimed Lynch.</p>

<p>"No; I've got a big job on my hands."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Making a chain."</p>

<p>"Making a what?"</p>

<p>"Making a chain."</p>

<p>"A watch chain?"</p>

<p>"I think it will be a watch chain; but I'll tell you
about it when we are alone. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"Keep still then."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span></p>

<p>Shuffles turned in, and the others followed his
example. He did not sleep, if they did, for his soul
was full of rage and malice. He was studying up the
means of revenge; and he had matured a project, so
foolhardy that it was ridiculous, and his mind was
fully occupied with it.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock he was called to take his place
with the first part of the port watch on deck. Belonging
to each quarter watch, there were five petty
officers, four of whom were to call the portion of the
crew who were to relieve those on duty. Shuffles
was called by one of these.</p>

<p>The wind was freshening when he went on deck,
and the ship was going rapidly through the water.
At the last heaving of the log she was making eleven
knots, with her studding sails still set. Mr. Fluxion
came on deck at eight bells.</p>

<p>Wilton, Sanborn, and Adler were in the watch with
Shuffles, and the malcontent lost not a moment in
pushing forward the scheme he had matured. Fortunately
or unfortunately, he was placed on the lookout
with Wilton, and the solitude of the top-gallant
forecastle afforded them a good opportunity for the
conference.</p>

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>"It's coming on to blow," said Wilton, as the lookouts
took their stations on the top-gallant forecastle.</p>

<p>"I don't think it will blow much; it is only freshening
a little," replied Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Now, what about the mutiny?" demanded Wilton,
impatiently, after he had become more accustomed to
the dash of the sea under the bows of the ship.</p>

<p>"Don't call it by that name," replied Shuffles, earnestly.
"Never use that word again."</p>

<p>"That's what you mean&mdash;isn't it? You might as
well call things by their right names."</p>

<p>"It's an ugly word, and if any one should happen
to hear it, their attention would be attracted at once.
We musn't get in the habit of using it."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are going to do yet,"
added Wilton.</p>

<p>"It's a big job; but I mean to put it through, even
if I am sure of failure."</p>

<p>"What's the use of doing that? Do you want to
get the fellows into a scrape for nothing?"</p>

<p>"There will be no failure, Wilton; you may depend
upon that. There will be a row on board within a
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
day or two, and, if I mistake not, nearly all the fellows
will be so mad that they will want to join us."</p>

<p>"What row?"</p>

<p>"Do you know the reason why I wouldn't shake
props this evening?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't."</p>

<p>"Lowington has found out what is going on in the
rooms."</p>

<p>"He hasn't, though!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he has."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"What odds does it make how I know?" answered
Shuffles, impatiently, for Wilton was much too inquisitive
to suit his purposes. "I talked with the chaplain
half an hour to-night. When he went to my
berth after the wine, I rather think he heard the rattle
of the props. At any rate the whole thing will be
broken up to-morrow or next day."</p>

<p>"I don't see how that will make a row. Not more
than a dozen fellows have played any; and they won't
think of making a row about that."</p>

<p>"You see!" added Shuffles, confidently.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" exclaimed Wilton, as a cloud of spray
dashed over the bow, and drenched the lookout; but
they wore their pea-jackets, and such an occurrence
was to be expected at sea.</p>

<p>"Stand by to take in studding sails!" shouted Paul
Kendall, who was the officer of the deck; and the
order was repeated by his subordinates in the waist
and on the forecastle.</p>

<p>"We must go," said Wilton; and they descended
from their position.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span></p>

<p>The wind had continued to freshen, until the ship
labored somewhat under her heavy press of canvas.
It was the policy of the principal to go as easily and
comfortably as possible, and he had directed Mr.
Fluxion, if the wind continued to increase, to have
the sail reduced, though neither the safety of the ship
nor of the spars absolutely required such a step. The
quarter watch on deck was sufficient to perform this
labor.</p>

<p>"Lay aloft, foretopmen!" said the second lieutenant;
and those of the watch who had their stations
in the fore rigging sprang up the shrouds. "Stand
by the halyard of the top-gallant studding sails! Man
the tacks and sheets!"</p>

<p>"All ready, sir," reported the second midshipman,
who was in the foretop, superintending the operation.</p>

<p>"Lower on the halyards! Ease off the tacks, and
haul on the sheet!"</p>

<p>The two top-gallant studding-sails were thus brought
into the top, where they were made up. The fore-topmast
and the lower studding sails were taken in by
a similar routine, and the Young America then moved
along less furiously through the water.</p>

<p>"Now about the chain," said Wilton, when
the lookouts had returned to their stations.</p>

<p>"Let me see; where did I leave off?" replied
Shuffles.</p>

<p>"You said there was to be a row; which I don't
believe."</p>

<p>"I may be mistaken about that; if I am, the job
will be all the more difficult. Lowington has got us
out to sea now, and, in my opinion, he means to shake
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
us up. He is a tyrant at heart, and he will carry it
with a high hand. I hate the man!" added Shuffles,
with savage earnestness.</p>

<p>"You may, but the fellows don't generally."</p>

<p>"They will as soon as he begins to put the twisters
on them. You won't hear him say, 'If you please,
young gentlemen,' now that we are in blue water.
You know how savage he was with me."</p>

<p>"Well, but you were disobedient. You told him,
up and down, you wouldn't do what he ordered you
to do."</p>

<p>"No matter for that. You had a chance to see the
spirit of the man. He was a perfect demon. He put
me in irons!" exclaimed Shuffles, still groaning under
this indignity. "I have been insulted and outraged,
and I will teach him that Bob Shuffles is not to be
treated in that manner! I will be revenged upon
him, if it costs me my life."</p>

<p>"The fellows won't go into any such desperate
game as that," replied Wilton, cautiously.</p>

<p>"But there will be fun in the thing," added the malcontent,
softening his tone. "We shall have the ship
all to ourselves. We needn't trouble ourselves anything
about Latin and Greek, and trigonometry and
algebra. We shall go in for a good time generally."</p>

<p>"It is all moonshine; it can't be done. What's
the use of talking about such a thing?" said Wilton.</p>

<p>"It can be done, and it shall be," replied Shuffles,
stamping his foot on the deck."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I am not quite ready to tell you yet."</p>

<p>"Very well; I don't want to know anything more
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
about it," answered the timid conspirator, who was
almost disgusted at the foolhardiness of the plan.</p>

<p>"I can get along without you," added Shuffles, with
assumed indifference.</p>

<p>"I would rather have you do so."</p>

<p>"All right; but you will want to come in when we
have got along a little farther."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall; if I do, I suppose the door will
be open to me."</p>

<p>"It may be open; but perhaps you can't walk into
the cabin then."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose the fellows who do the burden of
the work are going to be shut out of the cabin? If
you join at the eleventh hour, you will have to be
what you are now&mdash;a foremast hand."</p>

<p>"What can I be if I join now?"</p>

<p>"Second or third officer."</p>

<p>"Who will be first."</p>

<p>"I can't mention his name yet. He belongs in the
cabin now."</p>

<p>"You don't mean so!" said Wilton, astonished to
learn that his bold companion expected to find friends
among the present officers of the ship.</p>

<p>"I know what I'm about," replied Shuffles, confidently.</p>

<p>With this information Wilton thought more favorably
of the mad enterprise. If it was to be a winning
game, he wished to have a part in it; if a losing one,
he desired to avoid it. There was something in the
decided manner of the chief conspirator which made
an impression upon this doubting mind.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span></p>


<p>"I don't want to go in till I know more about it,"
said he, after walking two or three times across the
top-gallant forecastle.</p>

<p>"You can't know anything more about it until you
have been toggled," replied Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Toggled?" repeated the sceptic, curiously.</p>

<p>"This thing is to be well managed, Wilton. We
shall not use any hard words, that outsiders can
understand; and if any of them happen to hear
anything that don't concern them, they will not know
what it means. Will you join, or not?"</p>

<p>"I will," replied Wilton, desperately.</p>

<p>The strange words which Shuffles used, and the
confidence he manifested in the success of his project,
carried the hesitating lookout man. He was fascinated
by the "clap-trap" which the leader of "our
fellows" had adopted to help along his scheme, for it
promised to afford no little excitement during the
voyage.</p>

<p>"Now you talk like a man, Wilton," replied Shuffles.
"You shall be a member of the league at
once."</p>

<p>"What's the league?"</p>

<p>"The Chain League."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Shuffles, you have been reading
yellow-covered novels to some purpose."</p>

<p>"I didn't get this idea from a novel. I invented it
myself."</p>

<p>"The Chain League!" repeated Wilton, who was
pleased with the title of the conspirators.</p>

<p>"It will be called simply 'The Chain.' I am the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
first member, and you are the second; or you will be
when you have been toggled."</p>

<p>"Toggled again!" laughed Wilton. "What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"Initiated."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, then."</p>

<p>"Repeat after me."</p>

<p>"Go on," replied Wilton, deeply interested in the
proceeding, even while he was amused at its formality.</p>

<p>"<i>I am a link of the chain</i>."</p>

<p>"I am a link of the chain," repeated Wilton.</p>

<p>"<i>I will obey my superior officers</i>."</p>

<p>"I will obey my superior officers."</p>

<p>"<i>And I will reveal none of its secrets</i>."</p>

<p>"And I will reveal none of its secrets."</p>

<p>"<i>This I promise</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This I promise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>On penalty of falling overboard accidentally</i>."</p>

<p>"On penalty of what?" demanded Wilton, both
puzzled and terrified by the mysterious words.</p>

<p>"Repeat the words after me. On penalty," said
Shuffles, sternly.</p>

<p>"I know what the words are, but I'll be hanged if I
will repeat them. 'Falling overboard accidentally!'
What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that, if you betray the secrets of The
Chain, you might fall overboard accidentally, some
day."</p>

<p>"That is, you would push me over when no one
was looking," added Wilton, involuntarily retreating
from the conspirator, whom, for the moment, he regarded
as a very dangerous companion.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what the words mean," replied Shuffles,
coolly.</p>

<p>"Have I been toggled?" demanded Wilton.</p>

<p>"No; you didn't repeat all the words."</p>

<p>"Then you needn't toggle me any more. I've got
enough of this thing."</p>

<p>"All right; just as you say. But I can tell you
this, my dear fellow? if you should whisper the first
word of what has passed between us to-night, you
might fall overboard," continued Shuffles, sharply, as
he laid his hand on his companion's shoulder.</p>

<p>Wilton grasped the sheet of the fore-topmast staysail
which was the nearest rope to him, and held on
as though he was then in imminent danger of "falling
overboard accidentally."</p>

<p>"I won't say a word," protested he, vehemently;
for he did not know but that Shuffles was wicked
enough to push him into the sea.</p>

<p>"Wilton, you are a fool!" added the disappointed
conspirator, with deep disgust. "Why didn't you say
what I told you?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to be bound in any such way as that,"
replied the terrified student.</p>

<p>"Don't you see it is only a form?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't; or if it is, I don't want anything to
do with such forms. You won't get any fellows to be
toggled in that way."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall? I shall get plenty of them. They
are not babies, like you."</p>

<p>"I'm not a baby."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are&mdash;a great calf! What are you
afraid of?"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not afraid; I didn't think you meant to have
any murder in your Chain."</p>

<p>"I don't; no fellow will think of such a thing as
betraying one of the secrets."</p>

<p>"Then what's the use of having such a penalty?"</p>

<p>"It will prevent any fellow from opening his mouth
when he ought to keep it shut."</p>

<p>"I don't want anything to do with a concern that
means murder. I'm not any better than I should be,
but I'm too good for that."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself; but remember, if you should happen
to say a word, you will fall overboard accidentally,
some night when you are on the lookout, or out on the
yard-arm."</p>

<p>"Two bells," said Wilton, greatly relieved to hear
them, for he did not like to stand any longer on the
top-gallant forecastle, where there was no railing, with
such a dangerous fellow as Shuffles proved to be.</p>

<p>Two other members of the watch were sent forward
to take their places. Wilton and Shuffles went down
and mingled with their shipmates, who were talking
about what they should do and what they should see in
Ireland, where the ship would first make a harbor.
Wilton breathed easier, and the topic was a more
agreeable one than the dark and terrible matter which
had been under discussion on the top-gallant forecastle.</p>

<p>Shuffles was disappointed by the scruples of his
generally unscrupulous companion. He regarded the
machinery of the plot, the clap-trap of the secret
league, as decidedly attractive; and he depended
largely upon it to influence his companions. Though
he claimed that his plan was original, it was suggested
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
by a secret political organization in Europe, of which
he had read in a pamphlet; and the idea had doubtless
been modified by his more extensive readings in
the department of fiction, in which midnight juntos
laid out robbery, treason, and murder; Venetian tales
in which bravos, assassins, and decayed princes in disguise
largely figured; in which mysterious passwords
opened mysterious dungeons beneath ruined castles;
in which bravo met bravo, and knew him by some
mysterious sign, or cabalistic word.</p>

<p>Shuffles had a taste for these things, and out of his
lively imagination he had coined a similar association
to be recruited from the crew of the Young America,
which was to redress fancied wrongs, and even take
the ship out of the hands of the principal. He could
think of nothing but this brilliant enterprise; and
while his shipmates were talking of the future, and indulging
in the old salts' vocation of "spinning yarns,"
he was busy maturing the details of "The Chain
League." He did not, for reasons best known to himself
attempt to make any more proselytes that night.</p>

<p>The ship continued to go along easily on her course
till morning. It was a clear night, and though the
wind was fresh, the sea was not rough, and the Young
America behaved very handsomely. The programme
for the watches was carried out to the letter, but on the
first night out, the boys were too much excited by the
novelty of the situation to be able to sleep much.</p>

<p>At eight bells in the morning, after the port watch
had breakfasted, all the students off duty attended
prayers. Then the starboard watch had their morning
meal, after which all hands were piped to muster.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lowington mounted the hatch, and it was understood
that the case of discipline which had come up
the day before was to be settled now.</p>

<p>"Shuffles!" called the principal.</p>

<p>The culprit came forward.</p>

<p>"Are you still of the same mind as when I saw you
last evening?" continued Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>"I am, sir," replied Shuffles, with a becoming exhibition
of meekness.</p>

<p>"You will step upon the hatch, then."</p>

<p>Shuffles took position by the side of the principal.</p>

<p>"You will repeat after me," added Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>The culprit was startled at these words, and began
to suspect that Wilton had betrayed him in spite of
his fear of falling overboard accidentally. It looked
just then as though the principal intended to "toggle"
him.</p>

<p>"I acknowledge that I have done wrong," Mr.
Lowington continued.</p>

<p>Shuffles repeated the words, happy to find that
he was not to take the obligation of "The Chain
League."</p>

<p>"And I will hereafter endeavor to do my duty faithfully."</p>

<p>The promise was repeated with the lips, but of
course it had no meaning, and did not reach the
heart.</p>

<p>"That is all, Shuffles," added the principal.&mdash;"Young
gentlemen, you are dismissed from muster."</p>

<p>This was certainly a very mild atonement for the
grave offence which Shuffles had committed, and the
lenity of the principal was generally commented upon
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
by the boys. The starboard watch was piped below
to study and recite, while the port watch were to be
off and on during the forenoon. The first part now
had the deck, while the second was off duty, and the
boys belonging to it were permitted to remain on deck
or to spend their time in the mess rooms. They were
not allowed to linger in the steerage where the recitations
were going on, but might pass directly through
on their way to their apartments.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the first part of the port watch was
relieved, and the second part went on duty. Shuffles
and Wilton were at liberty now, but there appeared to
be a coldness between them, and Wilton sought another
companion for his leisure hours. Sanborn and
Adler belonged to his part of the watch, and he soon
joined them.</p>

<p>"There isn't much difference between being off
duty and being on," said Adler, as they seated themselves
on the main hatch.</p>

<p>"There will be a difference when we have to make
and take in sail every half hour. We had a big job
taking in the studding sails last night."</p>

<p>"They don't drive the ship," added Sanborn. "I
suppose if we were a merchantman, they would crack
on all the sail she would carry."</p>

<p>"She goes along beautifully," said Wilton.</p>

<p>"She was only making five knots the last time the
log was heaved."</p>

<p>"And the sea is as smooth as a mill-pond. We
shall not get to Queenstown for two months at this
rate."<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span></p>

<p>"Stand by to set studding sails!" shouted Pelham,
the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>"I wondered why they didn't do that before," said
Sanborn.</p>

<p>The fore and main studding sails were set, two at a
time, by the part of the watch on duty, the wind still
being well aft.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked Wilton, with a long
yawn, after they had watched the operation of setting
the studding sails for a time. "This is stupid business,
and I'm getting sleepy."</p>

<p>"Let us go below," suggested Sanborn.</p>

<p>"What for? The professors won't let you speak
out loud while the recitations are going on," added
Adler.</p>

<p>"We don't want to speak out loud. What do you
say to shaking a little?" continued Wilton.</p>

<p>"I'm with you," replied Wilton. "Can either of
you change me a half sovereign?"</p>

<p>Neither of them could, but they were willing to take
Wilton's due bills, till his indebtedness amounted to
ten shillings. The boys had already begun to talk the
language of sterling currency, and many of them were
supplied with English silver coins as well as gold.
The three boys went down at the fore hatch, and
removing their caps as they entered the steerage,
walked silently to Gangway D, from which they went
into mess room No. 8, which had thus far been the
headquarters of the gamblers. Seating themselves on
the stools, they used one of the beds as a table, and
in a few moments were deeply absorbed in the exciting
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
game. They spoke in whispers, and were careful not
to rattle the props too loudly.</p>

<p>After they had played a few moments, Shuffles came
in. They invited him to join them in the play, but he
declined, and soon left the mess room, returning to the
deck. In the waist he met Paul Kendall, who was the
officer of his watch, and, like him, was off duty. They
had generally been on good terms while in the after
cabin together, for then Shuffles was on his best
behavior.</p>

<p>"How do things go on in the after cabin now,
Kendall&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;Mr. Kendall?" said
Shuffles, in his most gentlemanly tones.</p>

<p>"About as usual, Mr. Shuffles," replied Paul.</p>

<p>"I am not a 'mister' now," laughed Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all the same to me. I am sorry you are
not with us now."</p>

<p>"So am I," added Shuffles. "I did not expect to
be on board this year, or I should have been there
now."</p>

<p>"You can be, next term, if you like."</p>

<p>"This thing yesterday has ruined all my prospects."</p>

<p>"That was rather bad. I never was so sorry for
anything in my life before," answered Paul, warmly.
"You and I were always good friends after we got
well acquainted, though I did vote for another at the
election a year ago."</p>

<p>"You did what you thought was right, and I don't
blame you for that. I always did my duty when I
was an officer."</p>

<p>"That you did, Shuffles; and we always agreed
first rate. Isn't it a little strange that I have not lived
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
in the steerage since the ship's company were organized?"</p>

<p>"That's because you were always a good boy, and
a smart scholar. I think you would not like it."</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for losing my rank, I should like to
try it," replied Paul. "I should like to get better
acquainted with the fellows."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like them in the steerage. You
would see a great many things there which you never
see in the cabin; a great many things which Mr.
Lowington and the professors know nothing about."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean, Shuffles?" demanded
Paul, astonished at this revelation.</p>

<p>"I ought not to say anything about it; but I believe
these things will break up the Academy Ship one of
these days, for the boys are growing worse instead of
better in her, and their folks will find it out sooner or
later."</p>

<p>"You surprise me!" exclaimed Paul, sadly, for he
held the honor of the ship and her crew as the apple
of his eye. "If there is anything wrong there, you
ought to make it known."</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought; but you know I'm not a tell-tale."</p>

<p>"You have told me, and I'm an officer."</p>

<p>"Well, I blundered into saying what I have. What
you said about going into the steerage made me let it
out. I am sorry I said anything."</p>

<p>"You have raised my curiosity."</p>

<p>"I will tell you; or rather I will put you in the
way of seeing for yourself, if you will not mention
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
my name in connection with the matter, even to Mr.
Lowington, and certainly not to any one else."</p>

<p>"I will not, Shuffles."</p>

<p>"The fellows are gambling in the steerage at this
very moment," added Shuffles, in a low tone. "Don't
betray me."</p>

<p>"I will not. Gambling!" exclaimed Paul, with
natural horror.</p>

<p>"You will find them in No. 8," continued Shuffles,
walking away, and leaving the astonished officer to
wonder how boys could gamble.</p>

<h4>THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>Paul Kendall, who had not occupied a berth
in the steerage since the first organization of the
ship, was greatly surprised and grieved to learn that
some of the crew were addicted to vicious practices.
Gambling was an enormous offence, and he was not
quite willing to believe that such a terrible evil had
obtained a foothold in the ship. He could hardly conceive
of such a thing as boys engaging in games of
chance; only the vilest of men, in his estimation,
would do so. Shuffles had told him so, apparently
without malice or design, and there was no reason to
doubt the truth of his statement, especially as he had
given the particulars by which it could be verified.</p>

<p>The second lieutenant went down into the steerage.
Classes were reciting to the professors, and studying
their lessons at the mess tables. There was certainly
no appearance of evil, for the place was still, and no
sound of angry altercation or ribald jest, which his
fancy connected with the vice of gambling, saluted his
ears. He cautiously entered Gangway D, and paused
where he could hear what was said in mess room
No. 8.</p>

<p>"I'm five shillings into your half sovereign," said
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
one of the gamblers; and then Paul distinctly heard
the rattling of the props.</p>

<p>"There's the half sovereign," added another, whose
voice the officer recognized as that of Wilton. "You
own five shillings in it, and I own five shillings."</p>

<p>"That's so," replied Sanborn, who appeared to be
the lucky one.</p>

<p>"Let us shake for the coin," added Wilton. "It's
my throw."</p>

<p>"That's rather steep."</p>

<p>"We get along faster&mdash;that's all. If I throw a
nick, or a browner, it's mine; if an out, it's yours."</p>

<p>"I am agreed&mdash;throw away," replied Sanborn,
without perceiving that the one who held the props
had two chances to his one.</p>

<p>The props rattled, and dropped on the bed.</p>

<p>"A browner!" exclaimed Wilton, thereby winning
all he had lost at one throw.</p>

<p>"Hush! don't talk so loud," interposed Adler.
"You'll have the profs down upon us."</p>

<p>"I'll go you another five shillings on one throw,"
said Sanborn, chagrined at his loss.</p>

<p>"Put down your money."</p>

<p>The reckless young gambler put two half crowns,
or five shillings, upon the bed, and Wilton shook
again.</p>

<p>"A nick!" said he, seizing the two half crowns.</p>

<p>"Try it again," demanded Sanborn.</p>

<p>Paul Kendall was filled with horror as he listened
to this conversation. When he had heard enough to
satisfy him that the speakers were actually gambling,
he hastened to inform Mr. Lowington of the fact.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
Paul was an officer of the ship, and this was so plainly
his duty that he could not avoid it, disagreeable as
it was to give testimony against his shipmates. It
seemed to him that the ship could not float much
longer if such iniquity were carried on within her
walls of wood; she must be purged of such enormities,
or some fearful retribution would overtake her.
There was no malice or revenge in the bosom of the
second lieutenant; he was acting solely and unselfishly
for the good of the institution and the students.</p>

<p>He went on deck again. Shuffles was still there,
and they met in the waist.</p>

<p>"You told me the truth," said Paul.</p>

<p>"You did not think I was joking about so serious
a matter&mdash;did you?" replied Shuffles.</p>

<p>"No; but I hoped you might be mistaken."</p>

<p>"How could I be mistaken, when I have seen, at
one time and another, a dozen fellows engaged in
gambling? Of course such things as these will ruin
the boys, and bring the ship into disrepute."</p>

<p>"You are right. My father, for one, wouldn't let
me stay on board a single day, if he knew any of the
boys were gamblers."</p>

<p>"It can be easily stopped, now you know about it,"
added Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it can. I will inform Mr. Lowington at
once."</p>

<p>"Remember, if you please, what I said, Mr. Kendall.
I am willing to do a good thing for the ship;
but you know how much I should have to suffer, if
it were known that I gave the information. I didn't
mean to blow on my shipmates; but you and I have
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
been so intimate in the after cabin, that I spoke before
I was aware what I was about," continued Shuffles.</p>

<p>"I shall not willingly betray you."</p>

<p>"Willingly! What do you mean by that?" demanded
the conspirator, startled by the words of the
officer.</p>

<p>"Suppose Mr. Lowington should ask me where I
obtained my information," suggested Paul.</p>

<p>"Didn't you see for yourself in No. 8?"</p>

<p>"He might ask what led me to examine the
matter so particularly. But, Shuffles, I will tell him
honestly that I do not wish to inform him who gave
me the hint; and I am quite sure he will not press the
matter, when he finds that the facts are correct."</p>

<p>"Don't mention my name on any account," added
Shuffles. "It was mean of me to say anything; but
the ship was going to ruin, and I'm rather glad I spoke,
though I didn't intend to do so."</p>

<p>"I will make it all right, Shuffles," replied Paul,
as he descended the cabin steps.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington was in the main cabin, and the second
lieutenant knocked at the door. He was readily
admitted, and invited to take a seat, for the principal
was as polite to the young gentlemen as though they
had been his equals in age and rank.</p>

<p>"I would like to speak with you alone, if you please,
sir," Paul began, glancing at the cabin steward, who
was at work in the pantry.</p>

<p>"Come into my state room," said the principal,
leading the way.</p>

<p>"I hope your business does not relate to the discipline
of the ship," continued Mr. Lowington, when
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
they were seated, and the door of the room was closed.
"If it does, you should have applied to the captain."</p>

<p>"This is a peculiar case, sir, and I obtained my
information while off duty," replied Paul, with some
embarrassment; for he had thought of communicating
his startling discovery to Captain Gordon, and had
only been deterred from doing so by the fear of betraying
Shuffles.</p>

<p>"I will hear what you have to say."</p>

<p>"There is something very bad going on in the steerage,"
said Paul, seriously.</p>

<p>"Indeed! What is it?" asked the principal, full
of interest and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Gambling, sir."</p>

<p>"Gambling!" repeated Mr. Lowington, his brow
contracting.</p>

<p>Paul made no reply; and he expected to be asked
how he had obtained the startling information.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure of what you say, Mr. Kendall?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am. In mess room No. 8, there are
three or four students now engaged in gambling. I
stood at the door long enough to find out what they
were doing."</p>

<p>"This is serious, Mr. Kendall."</p>

<p>"If you have any doubt about the fact, sir, I hope
you will take measures to satisfy yourself at once, for
I think the students are still there."</p>

<p>"I will, Mr. Kendall; remain in this cabin, if you
please, until my return," added the principal, as he
moved towards the door.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span></p>

<p>"You must be careful when you approach them,
sir, for the gamblers are very sly."</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington passed from the professors' cabin,
into the steerage, and proceeding to the entrance of
No. 8, he paused to listen. He heard the whispered
conversation about the stakes, and "nicks," "browners"
and "outs." The gamblers were by this time
highly excited by the game, and had not only become
imprudent, but absolutely reckless, so intense was the
fascination of their employment. Suddenly, but with
a light step, he entered the mess room. Wilton sat in
the berth, while his companions occupied stools outside
and their heads were close together.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington took Adler by the collar of his frock
with one hand, and Sanborn with the other, just as
Wilton had thrown the props upon the bed. With a
vigorous jerk, he tossed them back upon the floor, so
as to obtain a full view of the stakes and the gambling
implements. The culprits were astounded at this sudden
descent upon them; but before they could comprehend
the situation fully, the principal turned upon
his heel, and left the room without a word of astonishment
or censure.</p>

<p>"We're in for it now," said Wilton, as his companions
picked themselves up from the floor, and gazed
at each other with a sheepish look.</p>

<p>"That's so," replied Sanborn.</p>

<p>"We shall catch it," added Adler.</p>

<p>"We shall find out how the inside of the brig looks,
in my opinion," continued Wilton. "I was a fool to
play here, right in the steerage. Shuffles told me that
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
Lowington smelt a mice, and would make a row about
this thing."</p>

<p>"Shuffles told you so!" exclaimed Adler. "How
did he know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know? I believe the parson told him last
night, when he was in the brig."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so then?" demanded Sanborn.
"You have got us into a pretty scrape! That is the
reason why Shuffles wouldn't play himself."</p>

<p>"Yes, he said it was; but I didn't believe Lowington
knew anything about it; I don't see how he could.
He walked in here as straight as though he had been
sent for, and knew just where to go," said Wilton.</p>

<p>"Of course he did: you say Shuffles told you
Lowington knew all about it; and I suppose he has
been on the watch to find some fellows at it so as to
make an example of them."</p>

<p>"That's the whole of it. We might as well throw
the props overboard now."</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington returned to the cabin, where he had
left Paul Kendall. He was sadly disturbed by the
discovery he had made, for he had no suspicion before
that any of his pupils had made so much progress in
vice. He knew what a terrible evil gambling was
among men; that it was the forerunner of dissipation
and crime; and he felt the responsibility which rested
upon him as a guardian and instructor of youth.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kendall, your information was correct; and
I commend the zeal you have displayed in bringing
this fearful evil to light. How happened you to discover
it?"</p>

<p>"I had a hint from a source which I would rather
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
not mention," replied the second lieutenant, with some
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; one of the students, who berths in the
steerage, happened accidentally to let it out."</p>

<p>Paul said "accidentally," because he believed that
Shuffles had been betrayed into the revelation by their
former intimacy.</p>

<p>"And he does not wish to be regarded as an informer,"
added the principal.</p>

<p>"No, sir; after he had excited my curiosity, he told
me where I could find the gamblers at play."</p>

<p>"I understand his position, precisely," said Mr.
Lowington; "and I will not ask his name. The
information proves to be painfully correct, and there
appears to have been no malice in giving it."</p>

<p>"No, sir; I don't think there was: indeed, I know
there was not," added Paul, when he considered that
Wilton and the other gamblers were Shuffles' intimate
companions.</p>

<p>"This is a very serious matter, Mr. Kendall," repeated
the principal, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I think it is, sir; that is the reason why I came to
you, instead of going to the captain."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is better that you did so, on the whole,"
replied Mr. Lowington. "It has enabled me to see
the evil for myself. Have you any views in regard to
what should be done, Mr. Kendall?"</p>

<p>The principal often asked the opinion of the officers
concerning similar matters under discussion, perhaps
in order to teach them self-respect, rather than with the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
expectation of obtaining valuable suggestions from
them.</p>

<p>"I think there should be stricter discipline in the
mess rooms, sir," replied Paul, blushing to have his
opinion asked. "The fellows&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The students, you mean," interposed the principal.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," added Paul, blushing deeper than
before at this gentle rebuke.</p>

<p>The boys had a language of their own, which was
not tolerated by the faculty when it ran into coarseness
and slang.</p>

<p>"What were you about to say, Mr. Kendall?" continued
the principal, smiling at the confusion of the
young officer.</p>

<p>"The students can now do anything they like in the
mess rooms. They have plenty of money, and if they
want to gamble, they can. They were playing last
night when the first part of the starboard watch were
on duty."</p>

<p>"You are right, Mr. Kendall," said Mr. Lowington
"The students must be looked after in their
rooms. Has there ever been any gambling among the
officers in the after cabin?"</p>

<p>"I never saw any, or heard of any. I don't think
there has been."</p>

<p>"I hope not; but we must grapple with this question
in earnest," added the principal, as he led the way
out of the state room into the main cabin.</p>

<p>The chaplain and the doctor were there, and Mr.
Lowington wished to take their advice upon the serious
matter before him; and before he permitted the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
second lieutenant to retire, he stated the case to
them.</p>

<p>"Gambling!" groaned the chaplain.</p>

<p>"I detected them in the act myself," added Mr.
Lowington. "You may retire, Mr. Kendall."</p>

<p>"Why, this is awful!"</p>

<p>"Boys will do almost anything that men will," said
Dr. Winstock, the surgeon.</p>

<p>"Drinking and gambling!" ejaculated the chaplain.
"What are we coming to?"</p>

<p>"I fear there are other vices of which we know
nothing yet," added the doctor.</p>

<p>"Why, I'm afraid the Academy Ship will prove to
be a failure, after all," sighed Mr. Agneau.</p>

<p>"Not at all," argued Dr. Winstock. "We are in
position here to treat these evils properly. There are
no fond mothers and indulgent fathers to spoil the
boys, when the discipline becomes sharp."</p>

<p>"What can we do?" demanded the chaplain.
"Moral and religious influences seem to have no
effect."</p>

<p>"Have faith in your own medicines, Mr. Agneau,"
said the doctor.</p>

<p>"I have full faith in the medicine, Dr. Winstock;
but I fear I have not done my duty faithfully."</p>

<p>"You need not reproach yourself, Mr. Agneau.
You have been earnest in your work," interposed the
principal. "In a large community of young men, all
these vices and evils will appear. It was to meet them
that the keel of this ship was laid, and our institution
organized. I expect to find vice, and even crime,
among the boys. They that be sick need a physician,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
not they that be whole. These boys certainly behave
better on board the ship than they did on shore at the
various academies they attended. Pelham, who is now
fourth lieutenant, and has been first, was one of the
hardest boys in the school to which he belonged in
New York. He has given us no trouble here, though
he has been a little sulky since he fell from his former
rank. Shuffles, who, in the Brockway Academy, was
the worst boy I ever knew, without exception, behaved
himself astonishingly well for a whole year. I am
sorry to see that he has begun the second year badly."</p>

<p>"O, his is a very hopeful case!" said Mr. Agneau.
"He is penitent for his folly, and I never saw so great
a change in an individual as he exhibited on my second
visit to him last evening."</p>

<p>"I hope he will not disappoint you. I only mentioned
him to show what a benefit the ship had been
to him; for if it keeps him out of trouble even a single
year, it is so far a blessing to him, to say nothing of his
intellectual progress, which has been more than satisfactory.
The fact that there are gambling, and drinking
and other vices on board, does not diminish my
faith in the institution."</p>

<p>"It certainly ought not to do so," added Dr. Winstock,
who was not so sanguine a reformer as the chaplain
and was willing to wait till the medicine had
time to produce an effect. "Here is an evil: we
must meet it, and we needn't stop to groan over it.
What's to be done? that's the question."</p>

<p>"The officer of the watch must be required to visit
every room during the first watch at least," said the
principal.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span></p>

<p>"But those who are disposed to gamble will find
abundant opportunities to do so," suggested the doctor.
"A couple of them up in the maintop, or even in the
cross-trees, could shake props, 'odd or even,' and
play other games of chance, without being seen. I
don't think you have hit the nail on the head yet, Mr.
Lowington."</p>

<p>"The utmost vigilance we can use will not entirely
prevent evil. We depend upon moral influences, as
well as discipline, for the prevention and cure of vice
and error," added the principal.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid a lecture on gambling wouldn't do much,
good while the means of play were still in the hands
of the students. It would influence some; but others
are not to be influenced in any way: a strong arm
alone will meet their case."</p>

<p>"We can take the props from them," said Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>"You must go a step farther than that; you must
search the berths and lockers for cards, dice, or other
gambling implements. Even then you will not have
struck at the root of the evil."</p>

<p>"What is the root of the evil?" asked the principal.</p>

<p>"Money, sir!" replied the doctor, with unusual
energy.</p>

<p>"That is said to be the root of all evil," added Mr.
Lowington, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Among boys, money does more injury than we can
comprehend. A college friend of mine was wholly
spoiled by his allowance of money. His purse was
always full, which made him the prey of dissolute persons.
He always had the means of gratifying his
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
appetites, and is now a sot, if he is living. He began
to drink, gamble, and dissipate generally, before he
entered college: he was expelled in a year. Without
money, as a boy, he would have been saved from a
score of temptations. Every boy on board this ship
has a pocket full of sovereigns for his European expenses.
They are all young nabobs, and if you ever
let them go ashore, you will have your hands full,
Mr. Lowington. They will drink beer and wine, visit bad
places, gamble and carouse. While they have
plenty of money, you can hardly prevent them from
being a nuisance to you and to themselves."</p>

<p>"There is a great deal of force in what you say,
Dr. Winstock."</p>

<p>"Money will be the root of all evil to these boys,
most emphatically. Those who are disposed to gamble
will do so while they have money."</p>

<p>"The inference to be drawn from your remarks is,
that the students should not have pocket money."</p>

<p>"Most decidedly that is my opinion. If I had a
son, I wouldn't allow him a penny of pocket money."</p>

<p>"That would be rather hard," said the chaplain.</p>

<p>"I know it, but it would be the best thing in the
world for the boy. I don't mean to say that I would
never permit him to have money; but he should have
no stated allowance; and when he had a dollar, I
should want to know how it was to be expended."</p>

<p>"This question of money allowances has been under
serious consideration with me."</p>

<p>"You can't handle the boys in Europe with money
in their pockets. A regiment of soldiers could not
keep them straight."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span></p>

<p>"I think you are right, doctor. I am tempted to
take their money from them."</p>

<p>"Do it, by all means!" exclaimed Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>The chaplain regarded the measure as rather high-handed.
He thought it would belittle the boys, and
deprive them of some portion of their self-respect.
The instructors came into the cabin at seven bells, and
their opinions were taken. Four of the six were in
favor of taking all money from the boys. Mr. Lowington
had already reached this view of the case, and
it was resolved to take the important step at once, as
the best means of effectually putting a stop to the practice
of gambling.</p>

<p>Mr. Fluxion had been unable to attend this conference
for more than a few moments, for he was the
instructor in mathematics, which included navigation,
and he was compelled to superintend the observations,
which were made with separate instruments by himself
and by the two masters of the forenoon watch.
The position of the ship was found, and marked on
the chart, and the "dead reckoning" compared with
the result obtained by calculation.</p>

<p>At one bell in the afternoon watch, all hands were
piped to muster, and the gamblers readily understood
that this call was for their especial benefit.</p>

<p>"Wilton," said Mr. Lowington, from his usual
position.</p>

<p>The culprit came forward.</p>

<p>"With whom were you gambling in mess room No.
8, this forenoon?" asked the principal.</p>

<p>Wilton looked up at the stern dispenser of discipline.
If he did not know, it was not his business to tell.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span></p>

<p>"Answer me."</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You are telling a falsehood."</p>

<p>"I don't remember their names now," said Wilton.</p>

<p>"You do remember them; and for each falsehood
you utter you shall suffer an additional penalty."</p>

<p>"I'm not a tell-tale, sir," answered Wilton, doggedly.
"I don't want to tell who they were."</p>

<p>"Very well; why didn't you say that at first? I
have some respect for the student who dislikes to
betray even his companions in error; none at all for a
liar. Adler and Sanborn," added the principal; and
the two gamblers stepped up to the hatch. "Young
gentlemen, you are charged with gambling. Have
you anything to say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing sir," they all replied.</p>

<p>"Wilton, how much money have you lost at play?"</p>

<p>"None, sir."</p>

<p>"How much have you made?"</p>

<p>"Ten shillings&mdash;half a sovereign."</p>

<p>"From whom did you win it?"</p>

<p>"From Sanborn."</p>

<p>"Return it to him."</p>

<p>Wilton obeyed. Adler had won about a dollar from
Sanborn, which he was also compelled to restore.
Mr. Lowington was satisfied that others had gained
or lost by gambling, but as he did not know who the
other gamblers were, he did not attempt to have the
ill-gotten money restored; for he never made himself
ridiculous to the students by endeavoring to do what
could not be done.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington then made a very judicious address
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
upon the evil of gambling, pointing out its dangerous
fascination, and the terrible consequences which sooner
or later overtook its victims. He illustrated his remarks
by examples drawn from real life. The chaplain
followed him, detailing the career of a young man
whom he had attended in prison, and who had been
utterly ruined by the habit of gaming, contracted
before he was of age.</p>

<p>These addresses seemed to produce a deep impression
on the boys, and one would have judged by their
looks that they all regarded the dangerous practice
with well-grounded horror. Mr. Lowington took the
stand again, and followed with another address upon
"the root of all evil;" adding that, having money in
their possession, they would be tempted to gamble.</p>

<p>"Now, young gentlemen, I propose that you all
deliver your funds to me, taking my receipt for whatever
amount you deliver to me. When you have any
real need of money, apply to me, and I will restore
it," added Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>"Take our money from us!" exclaimed several; and
it was evident that the proposition was creating a tremendous
sensation among the students.</p>

<h4>PIPING TO MISCHIEF.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>After the offensive announcement that the
students were to deliver up their money to the
principal, and take his receipt for it, the crew were
dismissed from muster, after being informed that the
business of receiving the funds would be immediately
commenced in the steerage. The three gamblers were
not punished, except by the mortification of the exposure,
even by the loss of their marks, though Wilton was
confined in the brig one hour for each falsehood he
had uttered. Mr. Lowington knew that at least a
dozen of the boys were guilty of gambling; and as the
matter now came up for the first time, he did not
deem it expedient to punish those who had been discovered
hoping that the preventive measures he had
adopted would effectually suppress the evil.</p>

<p>Many of the students regarded the taking of their
money as an indignity. Only a few of them, comparatively,
had engaged in gambling, though many of the
occupants of the steerage knew of the existence of the
practice on board the ship. They were willing to
believe, and did believe, after the impressive addresses
to which they had listened, that games of chance
were a perilous amusement, but they were not quite
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
willing to acknowledge the justice of Mr. Lowington's
measures.</p>

<p>Most of the officers, and many of the crew, cheerfully
complied with the new regulation. They handed
their money to the pursers, and received a receipt for
the amount, signed by the principal. Others emptied
the contents of their exchequer sullenly, and under
protest; while not a few openly grumbled in the presence
of Mr. Lowington. Some of "our fellows"
attempted to keep back a portion of their funds, and
perhaps a few succeeded, though the tact of the principal
exposed the deceit in several instances. Whatever
may be thought of the justice or the expediency of
depriving the students of their money, it was evidently
an exceedingly unpopular step.</p>

<p>In the second dog watch, when Shuffles and Paul
Kendall were off duty, they happened to meet in the
waist; and the exciting topic of the day came up for
discussion, as it had in every little group that collected
that afternoon. Shuffles had accomplished his purpose;
he had accomplished far more than he intended.
He had expected nothing more than a general onslaught
upon gambling, followed by increased stringency
in the regulations, and a closer watch over the
students in their rooms, which would produce sufficient
irritation among the boys to suit his purposes. Now
the crew, and even some of the officers, were in a
ferment of indignation, and ripe for a demonstration
of any kind.</p>

<p>"The business is done," said Paul Kendall, as he
met the conspirator.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's overdone," answered Shuffles, seri
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>ously,
though he was actually in a state of exultation
over the effect which had been produced by the new
regulation.</p>

<p>"I hope not. I did not mention your name to the
principal in connection with the matter," added Paul.</p>

<p>"Didn't he ask you?"</p>

<p>"He did? but when I stated the case to him, and
told him the person who had given me the information
had let it out accidentally, and did not wish to
be known, he asked no more questions."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Kendall. This last measure is
so unpopular that I should have been cast out like an
unclean bird, if it were known that I gave the hint."</p>

<p>"No one shall know anything about it from me,
Shuffles. You did a good thing for the ship, and for
every fellow in it."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't be willing to believe that just
now," said Shuffles, laughing.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not? but it is a fact, none the less."</p>

<p>"I didn't think Mr. Lowington would go it quite so
strong. If I had, I shouldn't have told you what I
did."</p>

<p>"Why, are you not satisfied with what has been
done?" asked Kendall, with some astonishment.</p>

<p>"No, I am not. I am glad enough to see the gambling
stopped, but I don't think the principal had any
more right to take my money away from me than he
had to take my head off," replied Shuffles, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it will be better for the fellows to
be without money than with it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will; I don't know about that. Your
neighbor might be a better man if he were poor than
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
if he were rich: does that make it that you have any
right to take his property from him?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it does," replied Paul.</p>

<p>"The State of Massachusetts, for instance, or the
State of Ohio, makes laws against games of chance.
Why not make a law, if a man gambles, that all his
money shall be taken from him?"</p>

<p>"The state has no right to make such a law, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"But the principal goes a long reach beyond that.
He takes every man's money away from him, whether
he is accused of gambling or not. Do you think he
had any right to do that?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't made any law; but if you want law,
I'll give you some!" laughed Paul, who was disposed
to treat the subject very good-naturedly, especially as
there was so much loose indignation floating about the
decks.</p>

<p>"I don't mean law alone, but justice," added Shuffles.
"I call it high-handed injustice to take the
fellows' money away from them."</p>

<p>"Let me give you a little law, then," persisted Paul.
"How old are you, Shuffles?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen."</p>

<p>"Good! You are an infant."</p>

<p>"In law, I am."</p>

<p>"Suppose your uncle, or somebody else, should die
to-day, and leave you fifty thousand dollars: wouldn't
you have a good time with it?"</p>

<p>"I should, as soon as I got hold of it, you had
better believe," replied Shuffles.</p>

<p>"As soon as you got hold of it!" exclaimed Paul.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose I should have a guardian till I became
of age."</p>

<p>"Who would appoint your guardian?"</p>

<p>"The court, I believe."</p>

<p>"Exactly so! The law! What, take your money
away from you, or not let you touch it!"</p>

<p>"That's law, certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, wouldn't the law have just as much right to
take off a fellow's head, as to take his money?" demanded
Paul, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lowington is not our guardian."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is, for the time being; and I hold that he
has just as much right to take your money from you
as your father would have."</p>

<p>"I don't see it; I don't believe it. The money was
given us by our fathers to spend in Europe when we
get there."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lowington is to pay all our expenses on shore,
by the terms of the contract. Besides, the regulations
of the Academy Ship, to which all the parents assented,
require that the control of the boys shall be wholly
given up to the principal. It's a plain case, Shuffles."</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington and his policy had an able and zealous
defender in the person of Paul Kendall, who, by
his arguments, as well as his influence, had already
reconciled several of the students to the new regulation.</p>

<p>"If I were willing to grant the right of the principal
to take the fellows' money from them&mdash;which I
am not&mdash;I think it is treating them like babies to do
so. It is punishing the innocent with the guilty."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lowington said, in so many words, that the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
measure was not intended as a punishment; that it
was purely a matter of discipline, intended to meet
certain evils which must appear when we landed in
Europe, as well as to prevent gambling."</p>

<p>Paul certainly had the best of the argument; but
Shuffles was not convinced, because he did not wish
to be convinced.</p>

<p>At eight bells, when the first part of the port watch
went on duty, the wind had shifted from west to north;
the studding-sails had been taken in, the spanker,
main spencer, and all the staysails had been set, and
the ship, close-hauled, was barely laying her course.
The wind was fresh, and she was heeled over on the
starboard side, so that her decks formed a pretty steep
inclined plane. Under these circumstances, it required
a great deal of skill and watchfulness on the part of
the wheelmen to keep the sails full, and at the same
time to lay the course. As the ship's head met the
heavy seas, a great deal of spray was dashed on deck,
and the position of the lookout-men on the top-gallant
forecastle was not as comfortable as if the weather
had been warmer. There was no dodging; every
student was obliged to stand at his post, wet or dry,
blow high or blow low.</p>

<p>Wilton had been discharged from confinement in
the brig, where Mr. Agneau had visited him, giving
him good advice and religious instruction, as he did to
all who were punished in any manner, and was now
with his watch on deck. The new regulation was
particularly odious to "our fellows," and Wilton regarded
himself as a martyr to the popular cause, forgetting
that he had been punished for the lies he had
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
told. He and twenty others were forward to say they
"wouldn't stand it;" and the indignation seemed to
be increasing rather than subsiding.</p>

<p>"Well, Wilton, how do you like the inside of the
brig?" asked Shuffles, when they met in the maintop,
having been sent aloft to clear away the bowline
bridle on the main-topsail.</p>

<p>"I like it well enough," replied Wilton. "I wasn't
going to blow on the fellows; I would stay in there a
month first."</p>

<p>"Did you give up your money?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did; I couldn't help myself."</p>

<p>"How do you like the new regulation?"</p>

<p>"I don't like it any better than the rest of the fellows
do," answered Wilton, in surly tones. "I won't stand
it, either."</p>

<p>"O, I guess you will," laughed Shuffles. "I told
you Lowington was a tyrant, but you wouldn't believe
me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I would; and I did."</p>

<p>"The fellows will find out what he is before they
are many days older."</p>

<p>"I think they have found out now, I say, Shuffles,
was this the row you spoke about last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; only there's more of it than I expected."</p>

<p>"How did you know anything about it beforehand?"</p>

<p>"I have a way of finding out these things," replied
the artful conspirator, mysteriously. "I have one or
two friends at court."</p>

<p>"Is Paul Kendall one of them?"</p>

<p>"No; he is a simpleton. He don't know which
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
side his bread is buttered. If Lowington takes snuff,
Kendall sneezes."</p>

<p>"I have seen you talking with him two or three
times to-day."</p>

<p>"I was only pumping him."</p>

<p>"Well, there is a jolly row on board now, anyhow,"
added Wilton, as he prepared to descend over
the cat-harpings.</p>

<p>"Hold on; don't let's go on deck yet," interposed
Shuffles. "I want to know what our fellows are going
to do."</p>

<p>"They will call us down, if we stop here."</p>

<p>"When they do, we will go down, then," replied
Shuffles, as he seated himself in the top, with his legs
through the lubber's-hole. "What are our fellows going
to do? Do they mean to stand this thing?"</p>

<p>"They can't help themselves; they are mad enough
to do anything; but what's the use?" added Wilton,
as he seated himself by the side of his companion.</p>

<p>"Don't you think they will join the League now?"</p>

<p>"They would join anything that would give them
their rights. I'll join now; but I don't want to be
toggled in such a way as you said last night."</p>

<p>"Then you can't be toggled at all."</p>

<p>"I haven't any idea of falling overboard accidentally.
I'd rather lose my money than do that."</p>

<p>"It's nothing but a form, Wilton. Between you
and me, it's only a bugbear, intended to work upon
the nerves and the imagination. Of course we
shouldn't help any fellow overboard; no one would
dare to do any such thing."</p>

<p>"I don't like the sound of the thing."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span></p>

<p>"If you really mean to expose the secrets which are
intrusted to you, I advise you not to join."</p>

<p>"I don't mean any such thing," added Wilton,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"If you didn't, you wouldn't be afraid of the
penalty."</p>

<p>"Toggle me, then; and see what I mean."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to go in if you don't believe
in it."</p>

<p>"But I do believe in it; so go ahead."</p>

<p>Shuffles pronounced the ridiculous obligation again,
and Wilton repeated it after him.</p>

<p>"Now you are toggled," said the leader.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"Bring in the rest of our fellows; that is the first
job. In my opinion we can get over fifty of them
now."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," answered Wilton, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I'm very sure we can. If we get enough to take
the ship, we can have all the rest as soon as we have
done the job."</p>

<p>"Take the ship!" exclaimed Wilton, appalled at
the idea.</p>

<p>"That's what we mean."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you can do it," replied the doubtful
"link in the Chain."</p>

<p>"It's the easiest thing in the world. The affair will
come off at supper time, when the professors are all
in their cabin. All we have to do is to clap the hatch
on the after companion-way, and secure the doors
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
leading from the main cabin into the steerage. Then
we have them, and they can't help themselves."</p>

<p>"But the boatswain, carpenter, and sailmaker will
be loose."</p>

<p>"No, they won't. At the right time, we will pass
the word for them, and say that Lowington wants to
see them in the main cabin. As soon as they go
below we will put the hatch on."</p>

<p>"The cooks and stewards will still be at large."</p>

<p>"We can lock them up in the kitchen. If they
make trouble, I have a revolver," whispered Shuffles.</p>

<p>"A revolver! I won't have anything to do with it
if you are going to use pistols," said the alarmed confederate.</p>

<p>"It's only to look at; there will be no occasion to
use it," answered Shuffles, soothingly.</p>

<p>"There will be twelve men, besides the stewards,
locked up in the main cabin."</p>

<p>"That's so."</p>

<p>"How long do you suppose it would take them to
break down the bulkhead between the cabin and the
steerage, or to climb up through the skylight?"</p>

<p>"If they attempt anything of that kind, we can
show them the revolver; that will quiet them."</p>

<p>"You might frighten the parson in that way; but
do you suppose men like Mr. Lowington, Mr. Fluxion,
and Peaks, who have been in the navy so long, will be
afraid of a pistol?"</p>

<p>"They won't want to be shot, if they have been in
the navy all their lives."</p>

<p>"Then you mean to shoot them?"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span></p>

<p>"They will think we do, and it will be all the
same."</p>

<p>"I don't know about this business. I'm afraid the
pistol might go off, and hurt somebody."</p>

<p>"I suppose you could raise objections all night,"
added Shuffles, contemptuously. "I'm not going to
have any man tyrannize over me, Wilton. I suppose
if Lowington wants to pull every fellow's teeth out,
you won't object."</p>

<p>"I'm as much opposed to his tyranny as you are,
and I will do anything that is reasonable; but I want
to know whether the water is hot or cold before I put
my fingers into it. What's the use of blundering into
an enterprise, and making a failure of it?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea of making a failure of it. Did you
ever know me to make a failure of anything that I
attempted?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You failed to get elected captain when we first
came aboard of the ship."</p>

<p>"That was only because we had just come on
board? the fellows didn't know me, and I didn't know
them. We are better acquainted now, and I am just
as sure of success as though we had already won
it," added Shuffles, confidently. "I don't believe in
making failures."</p>

<p>"I don't believe there is more than one chance in
ten for you to succeed," continued the sceptic.</p>

<p>"There isn't more than one chance in ten for us to
fail. You are a bird of evil omen. You have no faith
in anything; and if you are going to croak like this, I
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
don't want you in the Chain," added Shuffles, petulantly.</p>

<p>"I'm in for it, already; and when I can see my
way clearly, I shall be as strong as you are."</p>

<p>"Then don't croak any more. We must go to
work while the fever is on the fellows, and make
up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the maintop, ahoy!" shouted the master, from
the waist.</p>

<p>"On deck!" replied Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Lay down from aloft!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The conspirators descended, after Shuffles had admonished
his shaky companion to be discreet.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in the top so long?" demanded
Foster, the first master, as the truants reached the
sheer-pole.</p>

<p>"Watching the sea, sir," replied Shuffles. "It
looks fine from the top."</p>

<p>"When you have done what you are sent aloft
for, it is your duty to come down and report it,"
added the officer.</p>

<p>Shuffles made no reply, as he probably would have
done if he had not had a heavy operation on his
hands, which prevented him from indulging in any
side quarrels.</p>

<p>Except the wheelmen and the lookout, the watch
on deck was divided into little groups, who were
quartered in the most comfortable places they could
find, telling stones, or discussing the exciting topic of
the day.</p>

<p>"Shuffles, some of our fellows want to see you
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
and Wilton," said Adler, as the first master went
below, to inspect the steerage, at two bells.</p>

<p>"What's up?" demanded the conspirator.</p>

<p>"Don't say anything," added the messenger, as he
led the way to the steerage skylight, under the lee of
which Sanborn and Grimme had stowed themselves
away, out of the reach of the stream that was flowing
along the water-ways, and of the spray which was
dashing over the weather bows.</p>

<p>The party from aloft, with the messenger, increased
the group to five, which was the total number of "our
fellows" that could be mustered in the first part of the
port watch.</p>

<p>"What's up?" demanded Shuffles, when he had
seated himself by the skylight.</p>

<p>"We intend to pipe to mischief, to-night, Shuffles
and we want some help from you," said Sanborn,
in reply.</p>

<p>"We have been robbed of our money, and we are
going to have satisfaction, somehow or other," added
Grimme, in explanation. "We are not going to stand
this sort of thing. We must teach Lowington and
the professors that they can't put our noses to the
grindstone."</p>

<p>"Exactly so!" exclaimed Shuffles. "And you
intend to put them there yourselves. In other words,
you mean to get into some scrape, and be punished
for it, as I was."</p>

<p>"No, we don't. We are going to work man-of-war
style. Old Peaks told us how to do it, when we
were on watch last night," replied Grimme.</p>

<p>"Peaks?"<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he spun us a yarn about man-of-war life, and
told us how the men serve out the officers when they
don't behave themselves."</p>

<p>"Peaks told you this&mdash;did he?" demanded Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Of course he didn't mean to have us do anything
of the kind."</p>

<p>"Well, how did he tell you to serve out the
officers?"</p>

<p>"Make them uncomfortable; keep them in a hornet's
nest all the time."</p>

<p>"How? How?" asked Shuffles, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Why, if the unpopular officer went forward, a
belaying pin was sure to drop on his head or his feet;
a tar can or a paint pot would be upset on his back;
or, if he went below, a cannon ball was liable to roll
out of a shot case upon him. Of course no one ever
knew the author of this mischief."</p>

<p>"Do you propose to play off any of these tricks on
Lowington?" demanded Shuffles.</p>

<p>"We have got a rod in pickle for him," replied
Grimme, chuckling.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"We intend to give him a dose of kerosene oil, to
begin with," laughed Sanborn.</p>

<p>"One of the stewards left his oil can on the fore
scuttle ladder, after the hatch was put on to keep the
spray out, and I took possession of it," added Grimme,
hardly able to keep his mirth within the limits of
prudence.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with it?" asked Shuffles.</p>

<p>"We are going to give Lowington the contents of
the can, and then throw it overboard."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed! Who is the fellow that has boldness
enough to do this thing?"</p>

<p>"I have; and I have volunteered to do the job,"
answered Grimme, with a degree of assurance which
astonished even Shuffles.</p>

<p>"You dare not do it!"</p>

<p>"I dare, and I will, if the fellows will stand by me.
Lowington is sitting at the table in the professors'
cabin, right under the skylight, reading. One section
of the skylight is open, and you can see him, as plain
as day. It's as dark as a pocket on deck, and the
officers can't see you twenty feet off. All I have to do
is to pop the oil through the opening, and get out of
the way."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Why, he will come on deck, and try to find out
who did it; but he can't."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he can."</p>

<p>"No, he can't; only half a dozen of the fellows
will know anything about it, and of course they won't
let on."</p>

<p>"Suppose he don't find out. What good will this
trick do?"</p>

<p>"The second part of the port watch must follow up
the game. Lowington will come on deck at eight
bells, and Monroe, in the starboard watch, will give
him another dose."</p>

<p>"What will that be?"</p>

<p>"Slush the first step of the ladder at the after companion-way,
and let him tumble down stairs," chuckled
Grimme.</p>

<p>"Then Lynch will give him some more," said Adler.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you may break his neck when he tumbles
down the ladder. I'll have nothing to do with any
of those tricks," added Shuffles, decidedly. "If you
want to pipe to mischief, I'm with you, but in no such
way as that. Those are little, mean, dirty tricks."</p>

<p>"But they will keep him in hot water all the time,
and he will get sick of being a tyrant over the fellows
in less than a week. There are twenty things we
might do to annoy him, which would help to bring
him to his senses. For instance, when the steward
carries the coffee into the professors' cabin, one fellow
might engage his attention, while another drops a
lump of salt, a handful of pepper, or a piece of
tobacco into the urn."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear any more of such low-lived
tricks," interposed the magnificent conspirator. "If
you want to pipe to mischief, let us do it like men."</p>

<p>"What would you do? Fifty of the fellows, at least,
will go into anything to punish Lowington for his
tyranny."</p>

<p>"Join the Chain, then," said Shuffles, in a whisper,
and with a suitable parade of mystery.</p>

<p>"The what?"</p>

<p>"The Chain."</p>

<p>The object of the League was duly explained; and
before the second part of the port watch came on
deck, three new members had been "toggled."
Greatly to the satisfaction of Shuffles, and to the astonishment
of Wilton, they did not hesitate at the penalty
of the obligation, and seemed to be entirely willing to
"fall overboard accidentally" if they failed to make
strong and faithful "links in the Chain."</p>

<h4>ALL HANDS, REEF TOPSAILS!</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>Augustus Pelham, the fourth lieutenant
of the Young America, was almost the only
malcontent among the officers; the only one who persistently
declined to be reconciled to the new regulation.
Others objected to it; others criticised it, and
even regarded the act as tyrannical; but the good offices
of Paul Kendall, who argued the question with them,
as he did with Shuffles, had in a measure conciliated
them, and they were at least disposed to submit gracefully
to the order. But Pelham was not of this number
He was above the average age, and, like the
chief conspirator on board, expecting to leave the ship
at the end of the first year, had not exerted himself to
the extent of his ability. He had been first lieutenant
and had now fallen to fourth. He was older than
the captain, and it galled him to be subject to one
younger than himself.</p>

<p>He was dissatisfied with his rank, and this had a
tendency to make him a grumbler. It needed only an
appearance of tyranny or injustice to array him in
spirit against the authorities of the ship. Shuffles
knew his state of mind, and was prepared to take
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
advantage of it, hoping through him to gain other discontented
spirits in the cabin.</p>

<p>When the first part of the port watch was relieved,
the "Chain" consisted of five links, and the conspirators
were well satisfied with the present success of the
enterprise. Each of the new members of the League
was commissioned to obtain a recruit, whose name
was given to him, and he was required to report
upon the case, to Shuffles, before eight bells in the
afternoon watch. As a measure of precaution, it was
required that no meetings should be held; that not
more than three members should assemble for business
at any one time. The utmost care and circumspection
were urged, and it was agreed that not a word
should be said in the steerage, where it was possible
for any of the professors to overhear it.</p>

<p>The second part of the port watch, with Pelham as
officer of the deck, went on duty at ten o'clock. The
wind had been freshening for the last two hours, and
it was now necessary to reduce sail. The royals were
first taken in, and then the top-gallant sails.</p>

<p>"We can't lay this course, sir," said Burchmore, the
quartermaster, who was conning the helm. "The
wind is hauling to the eastward."</p>

<p>"Make the course east by north then," replied Pelham,
without taking the trouble to consult the captain
or Mr. Fluxion, both of whom were on deck.</p>

<p>"The wind is north-north-east, sir," reported the
quartermaster, a short time afterwards.</p>

<p>"Keep her east then."</p>

<p>At six bells the wind was north-east, and coming
heavier and heavier every moment. The ship was
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
headed east-south-east, and it was evident that she still
had on more sail than she could easily carry.</p>

<p>"What's the course, Mr. Pelham?" asked Captain
Gordon.</p>

<p>"East-south-east, sir," replied Pelham.</p>

<p>"The course given out was east-north-east."</p>

<p>"I have changed it three times within the last hour,"
answered the fourth lieutenant, in rather surly tones.</p>

<p>"By whose order?" demanded the captain.</p>

<p>"By no one's order, sir."</p>

<p>"You know the regulation for the officer of the
deck. He is not permitted to alter the course of the
ship, unless to avoid some sudden danger, without
informing the captain."</p>

<p>"I had to alter the course, or have the topsails
thrown aback," replied Pelham.</p>

<p>"Very likely it was proper to alter the course; but
it was also proper to inform me, especially when I
was on deck."</p>

<p>"Very well, Captain Gordon. I will not alter the
course again without your order," added the fourth
lieutenant, stiffly.</p>

<p>"The regulation is not mine, Mr. Pelham," continued
the captain, sternly.</p>

<p>As the wind increased, sail was reduced to topsails
and courses, jib and spanker; but at seven bells even
these were found to be too much for her.</p>

<p>"Captain Gordon, it is coming heavier," said Mr.
Fluxion. "I think it will be necessary to reef."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of that, sir. The wind is north-east,
and blowing a gale."</p>

<p>"You had better call all hands, and do it at once."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Pelham, you will call all hands to reef topsails!"</p>

<p>"All hands, sir?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Pelham; that was my order," replied
the captain, more sharply than usual, for there
was something in the manner of the officer of the
deck which he did not like, and he found it necessary
to maintain the dignity of his position.</p>

<p>Pelham touched his cap; he felt the weight of authority
upon him heavier than ever before. Until
recently he had always performed his duty cheerfully,
and was considered a first-rate officer. Since the new
regulation had been put in force, and he had been
compelled to deliver up ten sovereigns in his possession
he had been rather disagreeable. In the cabin
he had used some language reflecting upon the principal,
and he was now regarded as a malcontent by
the captain, and by those who still sustained the discipline
of the ship.</p>

<p>"Morrison," called he, as he went forward to the
waist.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," replied the boatswain, who belonged
in this quarter watch; and there was a boatswain's
mate in each of the others.</p>

<p>"Call all hands to reef topsails."</p>

<p>The shrill pipe of the boatswain's whistle soon rang
above the howling winds, which now sounded gloomily
through the rigging. The call was repeated in the
steerage, and at the door of the after cabin, where it
could be heard by the officers, for no one on board is
exempted when all hands are called. This was the
first taste of the hardships of a seaman's life to which
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
the students had been invited. It is not pleasant, to
say the least, to be turned out of a warm bed in a
gale, when the wind comes cold and furious, laden
with the spray of the ocean, and be sent aloft in the
rigging of the ship, when she is rolling and pitching,
jumping and jerking, in the mad waves. But there
is no excuse at such a time, and nothing but positive
physical disability can exempt officer or seaman from
duty.</p>

<p>It was the first time the boys had seen a gale at sea,
and though it was not yet what would be called a
strong gale, it was sufficiently terrific to produce a deep
impression upon them. The ship was still close-hauled,
under topsails and courses, with jib and
spanker. The wind came in heavy blasts, and when
they struck the sails, the Young America heeled over,
until her lee yard-arm seemed to be dipping the waves.
Huge billows came roaring down from the windward,
crowned with white foam, and presenting an awful
aspect in the night, striking the ship, lifting her bow
high in the air, and breaking over the rail, pouring
tons of water on the deck.</p>

<p>Before the whole crew had been called, every opening
in the deck had been secured, and the plank guards
placed over the glass in the skylights. Life lines had
been stretched along the decks, and the swinging
ports, through which the water that came over the
rail escaped, were crossed with whale line by Peaks,
to prevent any unlucky boy from being washed
through, if he happened to be thrown off his feet
by a rush of water to the scuppers.</p>

<p>The scene was wild and startling; it was even ter
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>rible
to those who had never seen anything of the kind
before, though the old sailors regarded it quite as a
matter of course. Peaks had never been known to be
so jolly and excited since he came on board. He was
full of jokes and witty sayings; he seemed to be in
his element now, and all his powers of body and mind
were in the keenest state of excitement.</p>

<p>The students were disposed to look upon it as a
rough time, and doubtless some of them thought the
ship was in great peril. Not a few of them pretended
to enjoy the scene, and talked amazingly salt, as
though they had been used to this kind of thing all
their lives. Mr. Lowington came on deck, when all
hands were called; and though, to his experienced eye,
there was no danger while the ship was well managed,
he was exceedingly anxious, for it was a time when
accidents were prone to happen, and the loss of a boy
at such an hour, would endanger the success of his
great experiment. On deck, the students could not
get overboard without the grossest carelessness; but it
was perilous to send them aloft in the gloom of the
howling tempest. He had hoped that he might be
permitted to meet the onslaught of the first gale the
ship encountered in the daytime; but as the "clerk of
the weather" otherwise ordained it, he was compelled
to make the best of the circumstances.</p>

<p>Before the manoeuvre of reefing, in the gale, was
begun, Mr. Fluxion was sent forward. Bitts was
placed in the fore rigging, Peaks in the main, and
Leach in the mizzen, to see that the young tars did not
needlessly expose themselves, and that they used all
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
proper precautions to avoid an accident. All the officers
were at their stations.</p>

<p>"Man the topsail clewlines, and buntlines, and the
weather topsail braces," shouted Haven, the first lieutenant
who always handled the ship when all hands
were called. "Stand by the lee braces, bowlines, and
halyards."</p>

<p>The clewlines are ropes fastened to the corners of
the topsail, passing through blocks on the topsail yard,
and leading down to the deck through the lubber's
hole. They are used in hauling the corners of the
sail up when they are to be reefed or furled.</p>

<p>The buntlines are two ropes attached to cringles, or
eyes, in the bottom of the sail, which are used for
hauling up the middle, or bunt, of the topsail.</p>

<p>The braces are the ropes secured to the ends of the
yards, leading down to the deck, directly, or to a mast
first, and thence below, by which the yards and the
sails attached to them are hauled round so as to take
the wind. They are distinguished by the terms
"weather" and "lee," the former being those on the
side from which the wind comes, the latter on the
opposite side. They also have their specific names,
as the "weather fore-top-gallant brace," the "lee main
brace."</p>

<p>The bowlines are ropes attached to the leeches of
square sails to draw the edge forward, so that they
may take the wind better. They are fastened to the
bridles, which are loops like those of a kite, two or
three of them extending from the side of the sail.</p>

<p>The halyards are the ropes by which any sail is
hoisted. For square sails they are secured to the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
yards, which, with the exception of the lower one
on each mast slide up and down.</p>

<p>"Clear away the bowlines," said the first lieutenant
when all hands were reported ready for the
manoeuvre which had been ordered.</p>

<p>At this command the bowlines on the topsails and
courses were unfastened.</p>

<p>"All clear, sir," reported the officers from their
stations.</p>

<p>"Round in the weather braces, ease off the lee
braces!" was the next order. "Settle away the topsail
halyards! Clew down!"</p>

<p>To round in the weather braces was simply to haul
them up as the lee braces were slacked, so that the
yard was squared. As the command was executed,
the sail was "spilled," or the wind thrown out of it.</p>

<p>"Haul out the reef tackles! Haul up the buntlines!"
continued the executive officer.</p>

<p>To reef a sail is to tie up a portion of it, so as to
present less surface of canvas to the force of the wind.
Topsails are reefed in the upper part; a portion of
the sail nearest to the yard from which it is suspended
being rolled up and secured by strings to the yard.
Fore and aft sails, like the spanker, the fore and main
spencers, or the mainsail of a schooner, are reefed at
the foot, the lower part being tied down to the boom.</p>

<p>The topsails of the Young America had three reef
bands, or strips of canvas sewed crosswise over
them, in which were the reef points, or strings by
which the sail is tied up when reefed. When the first
or highest row of reef points was used, the sail was
single reefed; when the second was used, it was
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
double reefed; and when the third row was used, it
was close reefed. On each side of the sail, at the end
of each reef band, was a cringle, or eye, in which the
reef pendent was fastened. The reef tackle consists
of a rope passing from the eye, at the end of the reef
band, through a block at the extremity of the yard,
thence to the mast, and down to the deck. Hauling
on this rope draws the required portion of the sail up
to the yard in readiness to be reefed.</p>

<p>The reef tackles were hauled out, and the buntlines
hauled up to bring the sail where it could be easily
handled. When the sail is to be reefed, the seamen
have to a "lay out" on the yards, and tie up the sail.
To enable them to do this with safety, there are horses,
or foot-ropes, extending from the slings, or middle of
the spar, to the yard-arms. This rope hangs below
the yard, the middle parts being supported by stirrups.
When a man is to "lay out," he throws his breast
across the yard with his feet on the horse. The man
at the "weather earing," or eye for the reef pendent,
has to sit astride the yard, and pull the sail towards
him.</p>

<p>The foot-rope sometimes slips through the eyes in
the stirrups when only one hand goes out upon it,
which does, or may, place him in a dangerous position.
During the preceding day, when the barometer
indicated a change of weather, Mr. Lowington had
sent the old boatswain aloft to "mouse the horses,"
in anticipation of the manoeuvre which the boys were
now compelled to perform at midnight, in a gale of
wind. Mousing the horses was merely fastening the
foot-ropes to the eyes of the stirrups, so that they could
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
not slip through, and thus throw the entire slack of
the horse under one boy, by which he sank down so
low that his neck was even with the spar.</p>

<p>At the foot of each mast there is a contrivance for
securing ropes, called the fife-rail. It is full of belaying
pins, to which are secured the sheets, halyards,
buntlines, clewlines, lifts, braces, reef tackle, and
other ropes leading down from aloft. Looking at the
mast, it seems to be surrounded by a perfect wilderness
of ropes, without order or arrangement, whose
uses no ordinary mortal could comprehend. There
were other ropes leading down from aloft, which were
fastened at the sheer-poles and under the rail. Now,
it is necessary that every sailor should be able to put
his hand on the right rope in the darkest night; and
when the order to haul out the buntlines was given
in the gloom and the gale, those to whom this duty
was assigned could have closed their eyes and found
the right lines.</p>

<p>"Aloft, topman!" continued the first lieutenant,
when the topsails were in readiness for reefing.</p>

<p>At this order thirty of the young tars ran up the
shrouds, over the cat-harpings, and up the rigging, till
they reached the fore, main, and mizzen topsail yards.
Twelve of them were stationed on the main, ten on
the fore, and eight on the mizzen topsail yard. The
first, second, and third midshipmen were aloft to superintend
the work, and when the studding-sail booms
had been triced up, they gave the order to lay out, and
take two reefs.</p>

<p>When the hands were at their stations on the yard,
the first lieutenant ordered the quartermaster to "luff
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
up;" that is, to put the helm down so as to throw the
ship up into the wind and spill the sail, or get the wind
out of it, that the young tars might handle it with the
more ease.</p>

<p>The boys had been frequently trained in the manoeuvre
which they were now executing under trying
circumstances, and all of them knew their duty. If
any one trembled as the mast swayed over when the
ship rolled, he was afraid to mention the fact, or to
exhibit any signs of alarm. Perhaps most of them
would have been willing to acknowledge that it was
rather "ticklish" business to lay out on a topsail yard
at midnight in a gale of wind; and if their anxious
mothers could have seen the boys at that moment,
some of them might have fainted, and all wished them
in a safer place.</p>

<p>The boom tricing-lines were manned again, and the
studding-sail booms restored to their places.</p>

<p>"Lay down from aloft!" shouted Haven, when the
midshipman in charge aloft had reported the work
done; and he was obliged to roar at the top of his
lungs through the speaking trumpet, in order to be
heard above the piping of the gale and the dashing
of the sea. "Man the topsail halyards! stand by the
braces."</p>

<p>"All ready, sir," reported the fourth lieutenant, after
the others.</p>

<p>"Hoist away the topsails!"</p>

<p>The hands on deck walked away with the halyards,
until the topsails were hauled up to a taut leech.</p>

<p>The same operation was repeated on the fore and
main course; the yards were trimmed; the bowlines
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
attached and hauled out, and then the ship was under
double-reefed topsails and courses.</p>

<p>"Boatswain, pipe down!" said the executive officer
when the work was done.</p>

<p>But the crew did not care to pipe down, just then.
This was the first time they had ever seen a gale at
sea, and there was something grand and sublime in
the heaving ocean, and the wild winds that danced
madly over the white-crested waves. It was now after
midnight, eight bells having struck before the
courses were reefed, and the first part of the starboard
watch were to have the deck. Mr. Lowington
insisted that all others should go below and turn in,
assuring them that they would see enough of the gale
in the morning, or as soon as their quarter watches
were called.</p>

<p>The principal and Mr. Fluxion were earnest in their
commendation of the behavior of the Young America.
She was not only a stiff and weatherly ship, but she
behaved most admirably, keeping well up to the wind,
and minding her helm. The four boys at the wheel
handled it with perfect ease.</p>

<p>The ship did not labor in the gale as she had before
the sails were reefed; and though she jumped, plunged,
and rolled, making a terrific roar as she went along,
everything was ship-shape about her, and the boys
soon became accustomed to the exciting scene. She
was making but little headway, but she still kept within
three points of her general course. Mr. Lowington
remained on deck the rest of the night, anxiously
watching the ship and her crew in the trying experience
of the hour.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span></p>

<p>Augustus Pelham, the discontented lieutenant, went
below when his quarter watch was relieved. The
little incident, before all hands were called, between
himself and the captain, had disturbed him more than
he would have been willing to acknowledge. He
thought it was harsh of the captain to say anything to
him, though he had broken one of the rules of the
ship; and he regarded the gentle reproof he had
received as a very great indignity.</p>

<p>He went to his state room. The ship was rolling
fearfully, and he could not stand up without holding
on at the front of his berth. Goodwin, the third lieutenant
who was his room-mate, had already turned
in; but it was impossible for him to sleep. Pelham
took a match from his pocket and lighted the lamp,
which swung on gimbals in the room.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Pelham?" demanded Goodwin
"It is against the rule to light a lamp after ten
o'clock."</p>

<p>"I know it; but I'm not going to blunder round
here, and have my brains knocked out in the dark,"
growled Pelham.</p>

<p>"Put the light out; you will get into trouble,"
remonstrated his room-mate.</p>

<p>"I won't do it."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Go to sleep, Goodwin, and don't bother me."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Pelham? What ails you? I
never knew you to think of breaking one of the rules
before."</p>

<p>"I should like to break them all, as Moses did the
ten commandments. I have been insulted."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span></p>

<p>"Who insulted you?"</p>

<p>"The captain."</p>

<p>"Gordon?" asked Goodwin, in astonishment</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I never knew him to do such a thing as that. I
think you didn't understand him; or he must have
been excited by the gale."</p>

<p>"It was before it came on to blow very hard," replied
Pelham, seating himself on a stool, and bracing
his feet against the front of the berth to prevent being
thrown down.</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>"He snubbed me, told me I knew the rule, and was
as overbearing as though I had been his servant, instead
of an officer of the ship."</p>

<p>"But what did you do? He wouldn't have done
anything of the kind if you hadn't given him some
provocation."</p>

<p>"I told the quartermaster, when the wind was heading
off the ship, to alter the course."</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell the captain beforehand?"</p>

<p>"Not I."</p>

<p>"Then I don't blame him for snubbing you. What's
the use of being captain if the officers don't obey you?"</p>

<p>"If he had anything to say to me, he might have
been a little more gentle about it."</p>

<p>Pelham neglected to say that he was not particularly
gentle himself.</p>

<p>"Put that light out, Pelham, for my sake, if not for
your own," said Goodwin, when he found that his
companion was too much out of sorts to be reasonable.</p>

<p>"Neither for yours nor my own will I put it out,"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
replied Pelham, as he took a cigar from its hiding-place,
under the lower berth.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Pelham?" demanded
Goodwin, filled with astonishment, as he observed the
conduct of his fellow-officer.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have a smoke."</p>

<p>"But you know that smoking is positively prohibited
either on ship or shore."</p>

<p>"I haven't had a smoke since vacation," replied
Pelham, as he lighted the cigar.</p>

<p>"See here, Pelham; I won't stand this!" exclaimed
the third lieutenant, rising up in his bed, in which act
he was nearly pitched out of his berth by a heavy roll
of the ship. "The companion-way is closed."</p>

<p>"That's the very reason why I'm going to smoke,"
replied the malcontent, coolly.</p>

<p>"But I shall be stifled here."</p>

<p>"Can't help it."</p>

<p>"I can," retorted Goodwin, as he leaped out on the
floor.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I am going to inform Mr. Lowington what you
are doing."</p>

<p>"Are you such a fellow as that?" asked Pelham,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"I am, if you are such a fellow as to attempt to
stifle me with cigar smoke in my own room. It would
make me as sick as a horse in five minutes."</p>

<p>"Seasick, you mean," sneered Pelham. "I'm going
to have my smoke, if there is a row about it."</p>

<p>Goodwin put on his pea-jacket, and left the room.</p>

<h4>AFTER THE GALE.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>One of the most singular traits observable in
the character of some boys is the willingness,
and even the desire, under certain circumstances, to
get into trouble. A young gentleman, feeling that he
has been slighted, or his merit overlooked, permits
himself to fall into a mental condition in which he
feels no responsibility for his conduct; in which he
recklessly breaks through all regulations, places himself
in an attitude of opposition to constituted authority,
and seems to court the heaviest penalty which can be
inflicted upon him for disobedience, impudence, and
rebellion.</p>

<p>The fourth lieutenant of the Young America had
worked himself up to this disagreeable pitch. He
was not only disposed to assume an attitude of opposition
to the principal, who had made the obnoxious
regulation which was the immediate cause of his
rebellious condition, but to all who supported his
authority, or willingly submitted to it.</p>

<p>Smoking was a high crime on board the Young
America&mdash;not in the relation of the practice to the
ship, but to the student. It was condemned, not
simply because it would be offensive in the cabins and
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
steerage, and on deck, but because it was a bad habit
for a boy to acquire. The adult forward officers, the
cooks and the stewards, were allowed to smoke on the
forecastle at certain prescribed hours; but it was a
punishable offence for a student to smoke at any time
or in any place, whether on board or on shore.</p>

<p>Goodwin was indignant at the conduct of his room-mate,
for the third lieutenant was not only opposed to
smoking on principle, but the fumes of tobacco were
intensely offensive to him; and there was no doubt
that, in the confined space of the state room, insufficiently
ventilated, while all the openings in the deck
were closed during the gale, the smoke would make
him "as sick as a horse." He was a noble-minded,
manly youth, and had all a boy's detestation for tattling
and tale-bearing. He did not like to go on deck
and inform the principal of the conduct of Pelham,
but he could not submit to the indignity cast upon
him. He went out into the cabin, and threw himself
upon the cushioned divan, under the stern ports of
the ship.</p>

<p>This would have been a very satisfactory place
to sleep under ordinary circumstances; but Goodwin
had hardly secured a comfortable position, before the
heavy rolling and pitching of the vessel tumbled him
off, and he measured his length on the cabin floor&mdash;a
very undignified situation for a third lieutenant. He
picked himself up in the darkness, and tried it again,
but with no better success than before. He had fully
intended to go on deck and inform the principal of the
misconduct of Pelham, which had driven him from
his room; but he shrank from the task.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span></p>

<p>What Goodwin was attempting to do on the divan
many of the officers were striving to do in their berths,
though with better success than attended his efforts.
It was not an easy matter to stay in the berths; and
this done, the situation was far from comfortable.
Avoiding the rude fall on the one side, the occupant
was rolled over against the partition on the other side.
Sleep, in anything more than "cat naps," was utterly
impracticable, for as soon as the tired officer began
to lose himself in slumber, he was thumped violently
against the pine boards, or was roused by the fear of
being tumbled out of his berth.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington comprehended the situation of the
students, and when the topsails and courses had been
reefed, he called up all the stewards, and sent them
through the after cabin and steerage, to ascertain the
condition of the boys, and to give them the benefit of
certain expedients known to old voyagers for such
occasions. Jacobs, the steward of the after cabin,
entered to perform his duty. He had no light, not
even a lantern; for fire is so terrible a calamity at sea,
that every lamp was extinguished by the stewards at
ten o'clock, and no light was allowed, except in the
binnacle, without the special permission of the principal
Even the captain could not allow a lamp to be
lighted after hours.</p>

<p>Jacobs went to all the state rooms on the port side
first, and pulled up the berth sacks above the front of the
bunks, so as to form a kind of wall, to keep the occupant
from rolling out. A bundle of clothing was
placed on the inside of the berth, and the body was
thus wedged in, so as to afford some relief to the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
unstable form. Pelham's room was the second one
on the starboard side, and Jacobs came to it at last, in
his humane mission. He opened the door, and started
back with unfeigned astonishment to see the lamp
lighted, and the fourth lieutenant puffing his cigar as
leisurely as the violent motion of the ship would
permit.</p>

<p>"Contrary to regulation, sir," said Jacobs, respectfully
as he touched his cap to the reckless officer.</p>

<p>"Take yourself off, Jacobs," replied Pelham,
coarsely and rudely.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Jacobs did take himself off, and hastened on deck to
inform Mr. Lowington of the conduct of the infatuated
officer.</p>

<p>The principal immediately presented himself. Pelham
had fully believed, in his self-willed obstinacy, that
he could look Mr. Lowington full in the face, and impudently
defy him. He found that he was mistaken.
The experience of Shuffles in the hands of the boatswain
and carpenter would intrude itself upon him,
and he quailed when the principal opened the door
and gazed sternly into his face.</p>

<p>"Smoking, Mr. Pelham?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the rebel, with an attempt to
be cool and impudent, which, however, was a signal
failure.</p>

<p>"You will put out that cigar, and throw it away."</p>

<p>"I will; I've smoked enough," answered Pelham.</p>

<p>"Your light is burning, contrary to regulation."</p>

<p>"The ship rolls so, I should break my neck without
one," replied Pelham, sourly.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a weak plea for a sailor to make. Mr.
Pelham, I confess my surprise to find one who has
done so well engaged in acts of disobedience."</p>

<p>The reckless officer could make no reply; if the
reproof had been given in presence of others, he would
probably have retorted, prompted by a false, foolish
pride to "keep even" with the principal.</p>

<p>"For smoking, you will lose ten marks; for lighting
your lamp, ten more," added the principal.</p>

<p>"You might as well send me into the steerage at
once," answered Pelham.</p>

<p>"If either offence is repeated, that will be done.
You will put out your light at once."</p>

<p>The fourth lieutenant obeyed the order because he
did not dare to disobey it; the fear of the muscular
boatswain, the irons, and the brig, rather than that of
immediate degradation to the steerage, operating upon
his mind. The principal went on deck; Pelham turned
in, and was soon followed, without a word of comment
on the events which had just transpired, by
Goodwin.</p>

<p>The night wore away, the gale increasing in fury,
and the rain pouring in torrents. It was a true taste
of a seaman's life to those who were on deck. At
daybreak all hands were called again, to put the third
reef in the topsails. At eight bells the courses were
furled. The gale continued to increase in power
during the forenoon, and by noon a tremendous sea
had been stirred up. The ship rolled almost down to
her beam ends, and the crests of the waves seemed to
be above the level of the main yard.</p>

<p>In the popular exaggerated language, "the waves
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
ran mountain high," which means from twenty to
forty feet; perhaps, on this occasion, twenty-five feet
from the trough of the sea to the crest of the billow.
Even this is a great height to be tossed up and down
on the water; and to the boys of the Young America
the effect was grand, if not terrific. The deck was
constantly flooded with water; additional life-lines
had been stretched across from rail to rail, and every
precaution taken to insure the safety of the crew.</p>

<p>Study and recitation were impossible, and nothing
was attempted of this kind. The storm was now
what could justly be called a heavy gale, and it was
no longer practicable to lay a course. Before eight
bells in the forenoon watch, the royal and top-gallant
yards had been sent down, and the ship was laid to
under a close-reefed main-topsail, which the nautical
gentlemen on board regarded as the best for the peculiar
conditions which the Young America presented.</p>

<p>When a ship is laying to, no attention is paid to
anything but the safety of the vessel, the only object
being to keep her head up to the sea. In the gale,
the Young America lay with her port bow to the wind,
her hull being at an angle of forty-five degrees, with a
line indicating the direction of the wind. Her topsail
yard was braced so that it pointed directly to the
north-east&mdash;the quarter from which the gale blew.
The helm was put a-lee just enough to keep her in the
position indicated. She made little or no headway,
but rather drifted with the waves.</p>

<p>The young tars had a hard forenoon's work; and
what was done was accomplished with triple the labor
required in an ordinary sea. All hands were on duty
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
during the first part of the day, though there were intervals
of rest, such as they were, while the boys had
to hold on with both hands, and there was no stable
abiding-place for the body. The ship rolled so
fiercely that no cooking could be done, and the only
refreshments were coffee and "hard tack."</p>

<p>"This is a regular muzzler, Pelham," said Shuffles,
in the afternoon, as they were holding on at the life-lines
in the waist.</p>

<p>"That's a fact; and I've got about enough of this
thing."</p>

<p>"There isn't much fun in it," replied Shuffles, who
had been watching for this opportunity to advance the
interests of the "Chain."</p>

<p>"No, not a bit."</p>

<p>"It's better for you officers, who don't have to lay
out on the yards when they jump under you like a
mad horse, than for us."</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall have a chance to try it next
term."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"I lost twenty marks last night. I got mad, lighted
the lamp, and smoked a cigar in my state room."</p>

<p>"Will the loss of the twenty marks throw you
over?"</p>

<p>"Yes? I'm a goner!" added Pelham, with a smile.</p>

<p>"What made you mad?"</p>

<p>"The captain snubbed me; then Lowington came
the magnificent over me. A single slip throws a
fellow here."</p>

<p>A single slip in the great world throws a man or
woman; and young men and young women should be
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
taught that "single slips" are not to be tolerated.
More children are spoiled by weak indulgence than
by over-severe discipline. But a boy had a better
chance to recover from the effects of his errors in the
Young America, than men and women have in the
community.</p>

<p>By gradual approaches, Shuffles informed the fourth
lieutenant of the object of the "Chain," which Pelham
promptly agreed to join, declaring that it was just the
thing to suit his case. He was in a rebellious frame
of mind; and though he could not feel that the enterprise
would be a complete success, it would afford him
an opportunity to annoy and punish the principal for
his degrading and tyrannical regulation, as the recreant
officer chose to regard it.</p>

<p>By the exercise of some tact, the conspirators found
a convenient place under the top-gallant forecastle to
consider the project. Pelham was duly "toggled,"
and offered no objection to the penalty; indeed, he
only laughed at it.</p>

<p>"Suppose we get possession of the ship&mdash;what
then?" asked Pelham.</p>

<p>"We will go on a cruise. I understand that she
has provisions for a six months' voyage on board. I'm
in favor of going round Cape Horn, and having a
good time among the islands of the South Sea."</p>

<p>Pelham laughed outright at this splendid scheme.</p>

<p>"Round Cape Horn!" exclaimed he.</p>

<p>"Yes? why not? We should be up with the cape
by the first of June; rather a bad time, I know, but
this ship would make good weather of it, and I don't
believe we should see anything worse than this."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span></p>

<p>"What will you do with the principal and the professors?"
asked Pelham, lightly.</p>

<p>"We can run up within ten or fifteen miles of Cape
Sable, give them one of the boats, and let them go on
shore."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they won't go."</p>

<p>"We have ten fellows already in the Chain, who are
seventeen years old. If we get half the crew, we can
handle the other half, and the professors with them."</p>

<p>"All right! I'm with you, whether you succeed or
not. I'm not going to be ground under Lowington's
feet, and be snubbed by such fellows as Gordon. If I
want to smoke a cigar, I'm going to do it."</p>

<p>"Or take a glass of wine," suggested Shuffles.</p>

<p>"If there is any on board."</p>

<p>"There is, plenty of it. I'll make you a present of
a bottle, if you wish it."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Suppose we get the ship, Shuffles,
who are to be the officers?" asked Pelham.</p>

<p>"We shall have good fellows for officers. You will
be one, of course."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am higher in rank now than any fellow
who has joined the Chain."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a fact; but we are not going to mind
who are officers now, or who have been before. We
intend to take the best fellows&mdash;those who have done
the most work in making the Chain."</p>

<p>"Whether they are competent or not," added
Pelham.</p>

<p>"All the fellows know how to work a ship now,
except the green hands that came aboard this year."</p>

<p>"This is rather an important matter. Shuffles, for
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
everything depends upon the officers. For instance,
who will be captain?" asked Pelham, with assumed
indifference.</p>

<p>"I shall, of course," replied Shuffles, with becoming
modesty.</p>

<p>"That's a settled matter, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes; without a doubt it is."</p>

<p>"I may not agree to that," suggested the new
convert.</p>

<p>"You have already agreed to it. You have promised
to obey your superiors."</p>

<p>"But who are my superiors?"</p>

<p>"I am one of them."</p>

<p>"Who appointed you?"</p>

<p>"I appointed myself. I got up the Chain."</p>

<p>"I think I have just as much right to that place as
you have. Shuffles."</p>

<p>"I don't see it! Do you expect me to get up this
thing, and then take a subordinate position?" demanded
Shuffles, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Let the members choose the captain; that's the
proper way."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they will choose neither one of us."</p>

<p>"Very well; I will agree to serve under any fellow
who is fairly elected."</p>

<p>"When shall he be chosen?" asked Shuffles, who
was so sure of a majority that he was disposed to
adopt the suggestion.</p>

<p>"When we have thirty links, say."</p>

<p>"I will agree to it."</p>

<p>The conspirators separated, each to obtain recruits
as fast as he could. During the latter part of the day,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
the gale began to subside, and at sunset its force was
broken, but the sea still ran fearfully high. The fore
course was shaken out, and the ship filled away again,
plunging madly into the savage waves.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, the gale had entirely subsided;
but the wind still came from the same quarter, and the
weather was cloudy. The sea had abated its fury,
though the billows still rolled high, and the ship had
an ugly motion. During the night, the reefs had been
turned out of the topsails; the jib, flying-jib, and
spanker had been set, and the Young America was
making a course east-south-east.</p>

<p>"Sail ho!" shouted one of the crew on the top-gallant
forecastle, after the forenoon watch was set.</p>

<p>"Where away?" demanded the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>"Over the lee bow, sir," was the report which came
through the officers on duty.</p>

<p>The report created a sensation, as it always does
When a sail is seen; for one who has not spent days
and weeks on the broad expanse of waters, can form
only an inadequate idea of the companionship which
those in one ship feel for those in another, even while
they are miles apart. Though the crew of the Young
America had been shut out from society only about
three days, they had already begun to realize this
craving for association&mdash;this desire to see other people
and be conscious of their existence.</p>

<p>After the severe gale through which they had just
passed, this sentiment was stronger than it would have
been under other circumstances. The ocean had been
lashed into unwonted fury by the mad winds. A
fierce gale had been raging for full twenty-four hours,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
and the tempest was suggestive of what the sailor
dreads most&mdash;shipwreck, with its long train of disaster&mdash;suffering,
privation, and death. It was hardly
possible that such a terrible storm had swept the sea
without carrying down some vessels with precious
freights of human life.</p>

<p>The Young America had safely ridden out the gale,
for all that human art could do to make her safe and
strong had been done without regard to expense. No
niggardly owners had built her of poor and insufficient
material, or sent her to sea weakly manned and with
incompetent officers. The ship was heavily manned;
eighteen or twenty men would have been deemed a
sufficient crew to work her; and though her force
consisted of boys, they would average more than two
thirds of the muscle and skill of able-bodied seamen.</p>

<p>There were other ships abroad on the vast ocean,
which could not compare with her in strength and
appointments, and which had not one third of her
working power on board. No ship can absolutely
defy the elements, and there is no such thing as absolute
safety in a voyage across the ocean; but there is
far less peril than people who have had no experience
generally suppose. The Cunard steamers have been
running more than a quarter of a century, with the
loss of only one ship, and no lives in that one&mdash;a
triumphant result achieved by strong ships, with competent
men to manage them. Poorly built ships,
short manned, with officers unfit for their positions,
constitute the harvest of destruction on the ocean.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington believed that the students of the
Academy Ship would be as safe on board the Young
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
America as they would on shore. He had taken a
great deal of pains to demonstrate his theory to
parents, and though he often failed, he often succeeded.
The Young America had just passed through
one of the severest gales of the year, and in cruising
for the next three years, she would hardly encounter a
more terrific storm. She had safely weathered it; the
boys had behaved splendidly, and not one of them had
been lost, or even injured, by the trying exposure. The
principal's theory was thus far vindicated.</p>

<p>The starboard watch piped to breakfast, when the
sail was discovered, too far off to make her out. The
boys all manifested a deep interest in the distant wanderer
on the tempestuous sea, mingled with a desire
to know how the stranger had weathered the gale.
Many of them went up the shrouds into the tops, and
the spy-glasses were in great demand.</p>

<p>"Do you make her out, Captain Gordon?" asked
Mr. Fluxion, as he came up from his breakfast, and
discovered the commander watching the stranger
through the glass.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I can just make her out now. Her foremast
and mainmast have gone by the board, and she
has the ensign, union down, hoisted at her mizzen,"
replied the captain, with no little excitement in his
manner.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the teacher of mathematics,
as he took the glass. "You are right, Captain Gordon,
and you had better keep her away."</p>

<p>"Shall I speak to Mr. Lowington first, sir?" asked
the captain.</p>

<p>"I think there is no need of it in the present
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
instance. There can be no doubt what he will do when
a ship is in distress."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kendall, keep her away two points," said the
captain to the officer of the deck. "What is the
ship's course now?"</p>

<p>"East-south-east, sir," replied the second lieutenant,
who had the deck.</p>

<p>"Make it south-east."</p>

<p>"South-east, sir," repeated Kendall. "Quartermaster
keep her away two points," he added to the petty
officer conning the wheel.</p>

<p>"Two points, sir," said Bennington, the quartermaster</p>

<p>"Make the course south-east."</p>

<p>"South-east, sir."</p>

<p>After all these repetitions it was not likely that any
mistake would occur; and the discipline of the ship
required every officer and seaman who received a material
order, especially in regard to the helm or the
course, to repeat it, and thus make sure that it was not
misunderstood.</p>

<p>It was Sunday; and no study was required, or work
performed, except the necessary ship's duty. Morning
prayers had been said, as usual, and there was to be
divine service in the steerage, forenoon and afternoon,
for all who could possibly attend; and this rule excepted
none but the watch on deck. By this system,
the quarter watch on duty in the forenoon, attended
in the afternoon; those who were absent at morning
prayers were always present at the evening devotions;
and blow high or blow low, the brief matin and vesper
service were never omitted, for young men in the midst
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
of the sublimity and the terrors of the ocean could
least afford to be without the daily thought of God,
"who plants his footsteps in the sea, and rides upon
the storm."</p>

<p>Every man and boy in the ship was watching the
speck on the watery waste, which the glass had revealed
to be a dismasted, and perhaps sinking ship.
The incident created an intense interest, and was calculated
to bring out the finer feelings of the students.
They were full of sympathy for her people, and the
cultivation of noble and unselfish sentiments, which
the occasion had already called forth, and was likely
to call forth in a still greater degree, was worth the
voyage over the ocean; for there are impressions to be
awakened by such a scene which can be garnered in
no other field.</p>

<h4>THE WRECK OF THE SYLVIA.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>The people in the dismasted ship had discovered
the Young America, as it appeared from the
efforts they were using to attract her attention. The
booming of a gun was occasionally heard from her,
but she was yet too far off to be distinctly seen.</p>

<p>On the forecastle of the Academy Ship were two
brass guns, four-pounders, intended solely for use in
making signals. They had never been fired, even on
the Fourth of July, for Mr. Lowington would not encourage
their use among the boys. On the present
occasion he ordered Peaks, the boatswain, to fire
twice, to assure the ship in distress that her signals
were heard.</p>

<p>The top-gallant sails were set, and the speed of the
ship increased as much as possible; but the heavy sea
was not favorable to rapid progress through the water.
At four bells, when all hands but the second part of
the port watch were piped to attend divine service in
the steerage, the Young America was about four miles
distant from the dismasted vessel. She was rolling
and pitching heavily, and not making more than two
or three knots an hour.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the impatience of the crew, and
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
their desire to be on deck, where they could see the
wreck, the service on that Sunday forenoon was especially
impressive. Mr. Agneau prayed earnestly for
those who were suffering by the perils of the sea, and
that those who should draw near unto them in the
hour of their danger, might be filled with the love of
God and of man, which would inspire them to be faithful
to the duties of the occasion.</p>

<p>When the service was ended the students went on
deck again. The wreck could now be distinctly seen.
It was a ship of five or six hundred tons, rolling helplessly
in the trough of the sea. She was apparently
water-logged, if not just ready to go down. As the
Young America approached her, her people were seen
to be laboring at the pumps, and to be baling her out
with buckets. It was evident from the appearance of
the wreck, that it had been kept afloat only by the
severest exertion on the part of the crew.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peaks, you will see that the boats are in order
for use," said Mr. Lowington. "We shall lower the
barge and the gig."</p>

<p>"The barge and the gig, sir," replied the boatswain.</p>

<p>"Captain Gordon," continued the principal, "two
of your best officers must be detailed for the boats."</p>

<p>"I will send Mr. Kendall in the barge, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well; he is entirely reliable. Whom will
you send in the gig?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry Shuffles is not an officer now, for he
was one of the best we had for such service," added
the captain.</p>

<p>"Shuffles is out of the question," replied Mr. Lowington.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Haven, then, in the gig."</p>

<p>"The sea is very heavy, and the boats must be handled
with skill and prudence."</p>

<p>"The crews have been practised in heavy seas,
though in nothing like this."</p>

<p>The barge and the gig&mdash;called so by courtesy&mdash;were
the two largest boats belonging to the ship, and
pulled eight oars each. They were light and strong,
and had been built with especial reference to the use
for which they were intended. They were life-boats,
and before the ship sailed, they had been rigged with
life-lines and floats. If they were upset in a heavy
sea, the crews could save themselves by clinging to
the rope, buoyed up by the floats.</p>

<p>The Young America stood up towards the wreck,
intending to pass under her stern as near as it was
prudent to lay, the head of the dismasted ship being
to the north-west.</p>

<p>"Boatswain, pipe all hands to muster," said the
captain, prompted by Mr. Lowington, as the ship approached
the wreck.</p>

<p>"All hands on deck, ahoy!" shouted the boatswain,
piping the call.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant took the trumpet from the officer
of the deck, and the crew, all of whom were on
deck when the call was sounded, sprang to their muster
stations.</p>

<p>"All hands, take in courses," said the executive
officer; and those who were stationed at the tacks and
sheets, clew-garnets and buntlines, prepared to do
their duty when the boatswain piped the call.</p>

<p>"Man the fore and main clew-garnets and bunt
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>lines!"
shouted the first lieutenant. "Stand by tacks
and sheets!"</p>

<p>The fore and main sail, being the lowest square
sails, are called the courses. There is no corresponding
sail on the mizzenmast. The ropes by which the
lower corners of these sails are hauled up for furling
are the clew-garnets&mdash;the same that are designated
clewlines on the topsails.</p>

<p>The tacks and sheets are the ropes by which the
courses are hauled down, and kept in place, the tack
being on the windward side, and the sheet on the leeward.</p>

<p>"All ready, sir," reported the lieutenants forward.</p>

<p>"Haul taut! Let go tacks and sheets! Haul
up!"</p>

<p>These orders being promptly obeyed, the courses
were hauled up, and the ship was under topsails and
top-gallant sails, jib, flying-jib, and spanker.</p>

<p>"Ship, ahoy!" shouted the first lieutenant through
his trumpet, as the Young America rolled slowly
along under the stern of the wreck.</p>

<p>"Ship, ahoy!" replied a voice from the deck of the
wreck. "We are in a sinking condition! Will you
take us off?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" cried Haven, with right good will.</p>

<p>"You will heave to the ship, Mr. Haven," said the
captain, when she had passed a short distance beyond
the wreck.</p>

<p>"Man the jib and flying-jib halyards and down-hauls,"
said the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"All ready forward, sir," replied the second lieutenant,
on the forecastle.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span></p>

<p>"Stand by the maintop bowline! Cast off! Man
the main braces!"</p>

<p>"Let go the jib and flying-jib halyards! Haul
down!" And the jibs were taken in.</p>

<p>"Slack off the lee braces! Haul on the weather
braces!"</p>

<p>The main-topsail and top-gallant were thus thrown
aback, and the Young America was hove to, in order
to enable her people to perform their humane mission.</p>

<p>"Stand by to lower the barge and gig!" continued
Haven.</p>

<p>"Mr. Haven, you will board the wreck in the gig,"
said Captain Gordon.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied he, touching his cap, and handing
the trumpet to the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kendall, you will take charge of the barge,"
added the captain.</p>

<p>"The barge, sir," answered Kendall, passing the
trumpet to Goodwin, the third lieutenant, who, during
the absence of his superiors, was to discharge the duty
of the executive officer.</p>

</div>

<p>The boats were cleared away, and every preparation
made for lowering them into the water. This
was a difficult and dangerous manoeuvre in the heavy
sea which was running at the time. The professors'
barge, which was secured at the davits on the weather
side of the ship, was to be lowered with her crew on
board, and they took their places on the thwarts, with
their hands to the oars in readiness for action. The
principal had requested Mr. Fluxion to go in the
barge and Mr. Peaks in the gig, not to command the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>boats,
but to give the officers such suggestions as the
emergency of the occasion might require.</p>

<p>"All ready, sir," reported Ward, the coxswain of
the barge, when the oarsmen were in their places.</p>

<p>"Stand by the after tackle, Ward," said Haven.
"Bowman, attend to the fore tackle."</p>

<p>At a favorable moment, when a great wave was
sinking down by the ship's side, the order was given
to lower away, and in an instant the barge struck the
water. Ward cast off the after tackle, and the bowman
did the same with the forward tackle. At the
moment the order to lower was given, as the wave
sank down, the ship rolled to windward, and the boat
struck the water some eight feet from the vessel's side.</p>

<p>"Up oars!" said the coxswain, with energy.</p>

<p>"Lively, Ward," added the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Let fall!" continued the coxswain, as a billow
lifted the boat, so that those on board could see the
ship's deck. "Give way together!"</p>

<p>The barge, tossed like a feather on the high seas,
gathered headway, and moved off towards the wreck.</p>

<p>The lowering of the barge had been so successful
that the same method was adopted with the gig; but
as she was under the lee of the ship, there was less
difficulty in getting her off. She pulled round the
ship's bow, and having made less stern way in starting
both boats came up under the counter of the
wreck at about the same time. When the barge and
gig reached the ship, a line was thrown to each of
them over the quarter, which the bowman caught, and
made fast to the ring.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is the captain of the ship?" demanded Mr.
Haven.</p>

<p>"Here," shouted that officer.</p>

<p>"How many have you aboard?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen!"</p>

<p>"You must slide down on a rope over the stern;
we can't go alongside," continued the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!" responded the captain of the ship.
"I have two women and two children on board."</p>

<p>"You must lower them in slings," added Haven,
prompted by Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>The people on board the wreck went to work, and
one of the women was lowered into each boat at the
same time. A long loop was made in the end of the
rope, and the woman sat down in the bight of it, holding
on to the line with her hands. At a moment
when the sea favored the movement, the boats were
hauled up close to the ship's stern, the passenger
caught by two of the crew, and hauled on board. A
boy and a girl were let down in the same manner.
The captain, mates, and seamen came down the rope
hand over hand.</p>

<p>Each boat now had nine passengers, who were
stowed in the stern sheets and on the bottom. The
ropes from the ship were cast off, and the oarsmen
were ordered to give way. The barge and the gig
rose and fell, now leaping up on the huge billows,
and then plunging down deep into the trough of the
sea; but they had been well trimmed, and though the
comb of the sea occasionally broke into them, drenching
the boys with spray, the return to the Young
America was safely effected.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span></p>

<p>"How happens it that you are all boys?" asked the
captain of the wrecked ship, who was in Paul Kendall's
boat.</p>

<p>"That's the Academy Ship," replied the second
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"The what?" exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>"It is the Young America. She is a school ship."</p>

<p>"O, ay!"</p>

<p>There was no disposition to talk much in the
boats. The officers and crews were fully employed
in keeping the barge and gig right side up in the tremendous
sea, and though all hands were filled with
curiosity to know the particulars of the wreck, all
questions were wisely deferred until they were on the
deck of the ship.</p>

<p>When the gig came up under the counter of the
Young America, a line was thrown down to the bowman
who made it fast to the ring. The passengers
were then taken aboard in slings rigged on the
spanker-boom, which was swung over the lee quarter
for the purpose. Part of the boat's crew were taken
on board in the same way, and then the gig was
hoisted up to the davits with the rest in her.</p>

<p>Before the barge was allowed to come up under the
counter, the officer of the deck wore ship, so as to
bring the port quarter, on which the boat was to be
suspended, on the lee side. Her passengers were
taken on deck as those from the gig had been, and
she was hoisted up.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kendall, I congratulate you upon the success
of your labors," said Mr. Lowington, when the second
lieutenant reached the deck. "You have handled
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
your boat exceedingly well, and you deserve a great
deal of credit."</p>

<p>"That's a fact, sir," added Boatswain Peaks, touching
his cap. "I hardly spoke a word to him, and
I've seen many a boat worse handled in a sea."</p>

<p>Paul blushed at the praise bestowed upon him, but
he was proud and happy to have done his duty faithfully
on this important occasion. The same commendation
was given to the first lieutenant, after the barge
had been hauled up to the davits, and the order given
for the ship to fill away again.</p>

<p>The women and children were conducted to the
professors' cabin as soon as they came on board, and
the seamen were taken into the steerage. All of them
were exhausted by the anxiety and the hardships they
had endured, and as soon as their safety was insured,
they sank almost helpless under the pressure of their
physical weakness.</p>

<p>"This is a school ship, I'm told," said Captain
Greely, the master of the shipwrecked vessel, who
had also been invited to the main cabin.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; we call it the Academy Ship, and we
have eighty-seven young gentlemen on board," replied
Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>"They are smart boys, sir. I never saw boats better
handled than those which brought us off from the
ship," added Captain Greely, warmly.</p>

<p>"Your voyage has come to an unfortunate conclusion,"
said Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I have lost my ship, but I thank God
my wife and children are safe," answered the weather-beaten
seaman, as he glanced at one of the women
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
while the great tears flowed down his sun-browned
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Poor children!" sighed Mr. Agneau, as he patted
the little girl on the head; and his own eyes were dim
with the tears he shed for others' woes.</p>

<p>Captain Greely told his story very briefly. His
ship was the Sylvia, thirty days out of Liverpool,
bound to New York. She had encountered a heavy
gale a week before, in which she had badly sprung
her mainmast. Finding it impossible to lay her to
under the foresail, they had been compelled to set the
main-topsail, reefed; but even this was too much for
the weak mast, and it had gone by the board, carrying
the second mate and five men with it. The Sylvia
was old, and the captain acknowledged that she was
hardly sea-worthy. She became unmanageable, and
the foremast had been cut away to ease off the strain
upon her. Her seams opened, and she was making
more water than could be controlled with the pumps.
For eighteen hours, all hands, even including the two
women, had labored incessantly at the pumps and
the buckets, to keep the ship afloat. They were
utterly worn out when they discovered the Young
America, were on the point of abandoning their
efforts in despair, and taking to the boats, in which
most of them would probably have perished.</p>

<p>After the boats started from the Young America,
Mr. Lowington had ordered the cooks to prepare a
meal for the people from the wreck; and as soon as
they came on board, coffee and tea, beefsteaks, fried
potatoes, and hot biscuit were in readiness for them.
Tables were spread in the main cabin and in the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
steerage, and the exhausted guests, providentially sent
to this bountiful board, were cordially invited to partake.
They had eaten nothing but hard bread since
the gale came on, and they were in condition to appreciate
the substantial fare set before them.</p>

<p>By the forethought of Captain Greely, the clothing
of the women and children had been thrown into one
of the boats. The bundle was opened, and its contents
dried at the galley fire. The doctor and the
chaplain gave up their state room to the captain, his
wife and children, while Mr. Lowington extended a
similar courtesy to the other woman, who was Mrs.
Greely's sister. Mr. Fluxion was the first to offer his
berth to the mate of the Sylvia, which was reluctantly
accepted; and all the professors were zealous to sacrifice
their own comfort to the wants of the wrecked
visitors.</p>

<p>In the steerage, every boy, without an exception,
wanted to give up his berth to one of the seamen from
the Sylvia; but the privilege was claimed by the adult
forward officers, the cooks, and stewards. The principal
was finally obliged to decide between them: and
for obvious reasons, he directed that the guests should
occupy the quarters of the men, rather than of the boys.
The people from the Sylvia needed rest and nourishment
more than anything else. They were warmed,
and fed, and dried, and then permitted to sleep off the
fatigues of their severe exertion.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, though they had slept but an hour
or two, most of the shipwrecked people appeared at
divine service, for this was a privilege which they had
long been denied, and it would be strange, at such a
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
time, if the hearts of those who had been saved from
the angry flood were not overflowing with gratitude
to God for his mercy to them. Mr. Agneau, whose
sensitive nature had been keenly touched by the events
of the day, made a proper use of the occasion, delivering
a very effective address to the students and to the
shipwrecked voyagers, who formed his little congregation.</p>

<p>The next morning the wind came up fresh and
warm from the southward, knocking down the heavy
sea, and giving a delightful day to those on board the
ship. The passengers appeared on deck, and were
greatly interested in the Young America and her
juvenile crew. Captain Greely's son and daughter
were little lions, of the first class, among the boys.
All hands vied with each other in their efforts to do
something for the guests of the ship, and it really
seemed as though the era of good feeling had dawned
upon them. Even Shuffles and Pelham forgot, for a
time, the interests of the Chain League, and joined
with others in petting the children of the wreck, and
in laboring for the happiness of the involuntary
guests.</p>

<p>On this day, observations for latitude and longitude
were obtained, and at noon the ship was found to be
in latitude 42&deg;, 37', 5" N.; longitude 64&deg;, 39', 52" W.
The position of the ship was marked on the chart by
the masters, in council assembled, and the calculations
made for the course. Bowditch's Navigator, an indispensable
work to the seaman, was consulted frequently
both for the rules and the nautical tables it
contains. The course, after allowing for the variation
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
of the compass, was found to be north-east by east,
which, agreeing with the calculations of Mr. Fluxion,
was given out to the quartermaster conning the wheel.</p>

<p>The wind continued to blow fresh from the south
and south-west during the rest of the day and the succeeding
night; and the log-slate showed ten and eleven
knots until midnight, when the wind hauled round to
the westward, and soon came strong from that quarter.
At noon on Tuesday, April 5, the Young America
had made two hundred and forty-four miles during
the preceding twenty-four hours, which was the best
run she had had during the voyage.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of this day, a ship, bound to the
westward, was seen, and Captain Greely expressed a
desire to be put on board of her, with his family, as
he did not wish to return to the point from which he
had just come. The Young America bore down upon
the sail, and spoke her at sundown. Her captain was
willing to take the shipwrecked voyagers on board
his ship, which was bound to New York, and they
were transferred in the barge and gig. Captain
Greely and his party were very grateful for the attentions
they had received; and the little boy and girl
almost rebelled at the idea of leaving their new and
partial friends.</p>

<p>As the two ships were filling away, after the transfer
of the passengers, the seamen of the New York
ship, having learned what the Young America was,
gave three cheers, and dipped her ensign in compliment
to her. All the young tars were immediately
ordered into the rigging by Captain Gordon, and
"three times three" were most lustily given. The
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
American flag at her peak was lowered three times,
in reply to the salute of the stranger. As the Academy
Ship stood off on her course, the two children of Captain
Greely were seen, on the poop-deck of the other
vessel, waving their handkerchiefs; and they continued
to do so as long as they could be seen.</p>

<p>The departure of the guests had a saddening effect
upon the crew of the Young America, as they missed
the children and the ladies very much; for, during
their presence on board, the ship had assumed quite a
domestic aspect, and all the idlers on deck found
pleasing companions in the little boy and girl.</p>

<p>The limits of this volume do not permit a full detail
of the entire voyage across the ocean. Enough has
been given to show the discipline of the ship, and the
daily life of the boys on board of her. For the next
ten days the weather was generally favorable, and she
laid her course all the time. Some days she made
two hundred miles, and others less than one hundred.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth day from her departure, she was
in latitude 51&deg;, 4', 28" N.; longitude 31&deg;, 10', 2" W.;
course, E. by N. In going from Cape Race, the
southern point of Newfoundland, to Cape Clear, the
southern point of Ireland, the Young America did not
lay a straight course, as it would appear when drawn
on a map or chart. La Rochelle, on the western
coast of France, and Cape Race are nearly on the
same parallel of latitude, and the former is exactly
east of the latter. But the parallel on which both
points lie would not be the shortest line between
them. A great circle, extending entirely around the
earth in the broadest part, going through both, would
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
not coincide with the parallel, but would run to the
north of it a considerable distance at a point half way
between the two places, the separation diminishing
each way till the great circle crosses the parallel at
Cape Race and La Rochelle. The shortest course
between the two points, therefore, would be the arc
of the great circle lying between them. A skilful
navigator would find and follow this track. This is
called great circle sailing.</p>

<p>The Young America followed a great circle from
Cape Race to Cape Clear. Off the former point, her
course was two points north of east; off the latter, it
was half a point south of east. On her twentieth day
out she sailed due east.</p>

<p>After the excitement of the wreck and the departure
of the passengers, Shuffles and his confederates resumed
their operations in the Chain League, assisted
somewhat by a case of discipline which occurred at
this time. When the ship was sixteen days out the
Chain consisted of thirty-one links, in the cabalistic
language of the conspirators, and Shuffles was in
favor of striking the blow.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p><span class="pageno"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span></p>

<h4>PEAS AND BEANS.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>The business of the Chain had been managed
with extreme caution by the conspirators, and
more than one third of the crew had been initiated without
the knowledge of the principal and professors, or
of the officers and seamen who were not members.
Pelham and Shuffles ordered the affairs of the League,
and no "link" was allowed to approach an outsider
for the purpose of inducing him to join without the
consent of one of these worthies.</p>

<p>As the scheme progressed, various modifications had
been made in the plan to adapt it to circumstances,
the principal of which was the choice of two "shackles,"
who should be deemed the officers of the
League until a regular election had taken place. By
this invention, Shuffles and Pelham had been enabled
to compromise their differences, for they assumed the
newly-created offices, and labored as equals in the bad
cause. Each endeavored to make as many new
"links" as possible, for already the conspirators consisted
of two factions, one of which favored the election
of Shuffles, and the other that of Pelham, to the
captaincy. Each, in a measure, controlled his own
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
recruits, and was reasonably sure of their votes when
the election should be ordered.</p>

<p>These young gentlemen were not only plotting to
take the ship, but to "take in" each other. While
both worked for the League as a whole, each worked
for himself as an individual. Shuffles was much more
thorough than his rival in the making of his converts.
He told them the whole story, and taught them to look
full in the face the extreme peril of the undertaking.
He did not conceal anything from them. On the
other hand, Pelham merely represented the project as
a means of redressing the grievances of the officers
and crew; of having their money restored to them,
and abolishing certain portions of the regulations
which pressed hard upon those who were disposed to
be unruly.</p>

<p>Though the number of "links" in the "Chain"
has been mentioned, it was not known to either of
the rivals. Each knew his own peculiar followers,
but he did not know how many the other could muster.
Though there were signs and passwords by
which the members could know each other, there were
no means by which any one could precisely sum up
the whole number of "links." Shuffles could count
thirteen including his rival, while Pelham could number
nineteen without his coequal in authority. The
former believed the list to consist of about twenty four,
while the latter estimated it above thirty. With them
it was a struggle for an office, as well as to redress
their fancied wrongs, and they mutually deceived each
other in order to obtain the advantage.</p>

<p>"How many do you suppose we can muster now?"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
asked Shuffles, on the evening of the eighteenth day
out, as they met in the waist, when both were off duty.</p>

<p>"About twenty," replied Pelham.</p>

<p>"There are more than that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there are."</p>

<p>"But it is time to stretch the Chain," added Shuffles,
in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"If we are ever going to do anything, we must
begin soon. We have so many members now that the
danger of exposure increases every day."</p>

<p>"We can't do anything here. Besides, I am not in
favor of having the time or the manner of accomplishing
the work talked about among the members. I
believe in one-man power in an affair of this sort.
There should be one head, who should plan and command;
all the rest should obey. If every step in the
thing must be discussed and agreed upon, we shall
never do anything. One fellow will want it done in
one way, and another in some other way."</p>

<p>"I think you are more than half right," replied
Shuffles, who was confident that he should be the
person chosen to arrange the plans and issue the
commands.</p>

<p>"I know I am wholly right," added Pelham, who
was equally confident that he should enjoy the undivided
sway of the League. "If you are chosen captain
I will cheerfully obey your orders. I go a step
farther: whoever is elected captain should appoint his
own officers."</p>

<p>"I will agree to that also," replied the complaisant
Shuffles.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, then; the understanding is, that when
one of us is elected captain, he shall appoint his own
officers, and do all the planning and all the commanding,"
answered Pelham.</p>

<p>"Exactly so; we are now in about longitude thirty-one,
and Cork Harbor is in longitude eight, according
to Bowditch, for I was looking the matter up in the
steerage to-day. We have to make about twenty-three
degrees more. A degree of longitude, in latitude fifty-one,
is thirty-seven and three quarters miles, which
would make it eight hundred and sixty-eight miles
more to run in order to reach Queenstown. You see
I am posted," said Shuffles.</p>

<p>"I see you are. By the way, had you noticed that
Queenstown is not in the Navigator, or on the older
maps?" added Pelham.</p>

<p>"Yes; the place was called the Cove of Cork until
1849, when, in honor of her majesty's visit to the town,
the name was changed to Queenstown."</p>

<p>"All right," said Pelham.</p>

<p>It need not be supposed that the distance to Queenstown
and the change in the name of that place had
anything to do with the League. The fact was, that
Mr. Fluxion had passed near the conspirators, and had
paused a moment in the waist to glance up at the fore-top-gallant
sail, which was not in good trim; and the
conversation had been changed to suit the occasion.
In talking of the affairs of the "Chain," it was required
that one of the party should look forward, and the
other aft, if there were two of them; and that the third,
if there were three, should stand back to the nearest
rail. It was further required that the conversation
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
should not take place in a situation where it would be
possible for any one to overhear them. The lee side
of the waist,&mdash;the midshipman of the watch always
being on the weather side,&mdash;the top-gallant forecastle,
and the tops were the favorite resorts of the conspirators.
If any one approached, the parties in conversation
were instantly to change the topic, as Shuffles
had done.</p>

<p>"I think it is about time for the election to take
place," continued Shuffles, when Mr. Fluxion had
gone aft.</p>

<p>"Whenever you are ready, I am," replied Pelham.</p>

<p>"I am ready now."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"Very well; it shall come off to-morrow, say."</p>

<p>"To-morrow it is, then."</p>

<p>"But how shall it be conducted?" asked Shuffles.</p>

<p>"That will not be an easy matter. I think, however
we can hit upon some plan for having it fairly
done."</p>

<p>"Of course the matter lies between you and me,"
added Shuffles.</p>

<p>"To be sure."</p>

<p>"I suppose both of us are ready to abide the issue,
whatever it may be," said Shuffles, who was not a little
fearful that his powerful rival would refuse to acknowledge
him when he was chosen, as he confidently expected
to be.</p>

<p>"I pledge you my word and honor, that I will obey
you in all things if you are fairly elected captain,"
replied Pelham, who was equally sure of being chosen
himself.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span></p>

<p>"Fairly? Who is to decide whether it is fairly done
or not?" demanded Shuffles, unwilling to leave a loop-hole
through which his companion could crawl out
of the bargain.</p>

<p>"When we have agreed upon the means of electing
the captain, the choice shall be final."</p>

<p>"Good! You and I shall have no difficulty!" exclaimed
Shuffles, rather astonished to find his rival so
easily managed, as he regarded it.</p>

<p>"We will make it a little more binding, if you
choose," suggested Pelham, who, the reader has
already been assured by the figures given, was completely
outwitting the author and inventor of the
Chain League.</p>

<p>"With all my heart!"</p>

<p>"We will toggle each other on this special question
if you like."</p>

<p>"The stronger we make the bond the better," said
Shuffles. "Repeat after me."</p>

<p>"Not here, Shuffles. There is a steamer on our
weather bow. Let's go up into the mizzentop, and
have a look at her with a night glass."</p>

<p>Mr. Haven, the first lieutenant, who was in charge
of the deck, permitted them to go aloft with the glass,
for the officers were empowered to grant small favors.
On reaching the top, they glanced at the steamer, and
then resumed the conversation which had been suspended
on deck, it being too dark for the officers
below to see what they were doing.</p>

<p>"Now go ahead," said Pelham.</p>

<p>"Repeat after me."</p>

<p>"All right."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span></p>

<p>"I promise, without any reservation, to acknowledge
Shuffles as captain, if he is chosen, and faithfully
to obey his orders, on penalty of falling overboard accidentally."</p>

<p>Pelham repeated these words, and then "toggled"
his rival in the same manner.</p>

<p>"Now we understand each other perfectly, and
there will be no chance of dragging the anchor," said
Shuffles, satisfied that his sway would be undisputed.
"Let me say, in addition to this, that if I should happen
to be chosen, I shall make you my first officer,
Pelham."</p>

<p>"And I will make you my first officer, if I should
happen to be chosen," replied the obliging Pelham.
"Of course I don't expect to be chosen; you have had
the swing of this affair, and you will have all the
advantage."</p>

<p>"No, I think not; you are an officer now, and you
have more influence than I have," added the modest
Shuffles.</p>

<p>If both had been laboring for the organization of
the League on the same terms, Shuffles would certainly
have the better chance of an election; but Pelham
had been taking in members on false pretences, merely
representing to those whom he approached that the
League was an association having for its object the
redress of their grievances. To only a few had he
mentioned the fact that a regular mutiny was contemplated;
that the ship was to be taken out of the hands
of the principal, and an independent cruise commenced.
He was afraid the whole truth would be
more than some of them could bear; and perhaps
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
he had so little faith in the extreme measures to be
carried out by the League, that he was unwilling even
to mention them.</p>

<p>Those who serve the evil one can neither trust each
other nor trust their master.</p>

<p>The only real confidence in each other which can
exist among men or boys must be based on moral and
religious principle.</p>

<p>The man who pays his debts, or who performs his
obligations to his fellow-men, for his reputation's sake,
rather than from devotion to pure principle, will fail of
his duty when he can conceal his infidelity, or when
his reputation will not suffer from his acts.</p>

<p>A man or a boy without principle is not to be trusted
out of the line of his own interest.</p>

<p>While Shuffles and Pelham were pledging themselves
to a kind of romantic fidelity, they were plotting
each against the other, each being satisfied that
he had the advantage of the other.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm afraid the election will give us some
trouble," continued Shuffles. "It will not be an easy
matter to conduct it fairly&mdash;not that any fellow means
to cheat, but it must be conducted with so much
secrecy that we can't superintend the ballot properly."</p>

<p>"I know there is all that difficulty, but I have
thought of a method which I believe will give us a
fair election," replied Pelham.</p>

<p>"Have you? So have I."</p>

<p>"Well, what is your plan? If it is better than
mine, I am willing to adopt it."</p>

<p>"I was thinking, as you and I are the only candidates
that each of us might be represented by one side
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
of the ship. You shall be port, and I will be starboard
Then every link in the Chain shall hand his
vote, on which shall be written the single word port or
starboard either to you or me; and if there are more
port than starboard, you will be captain; if more starboard
than port, I shall be captain! How does that
idea strike you?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well; but the fellows have all got to write
their votes, and others will want to know what it
means. It will set outsiders to thinking, and I don't
believe the plan is quite safe."</p>

<p>"Well, what is your method?" asked Shuffles, who
was willing to acknowledge the force of his rival's
objections.</p>

<p>"Perhaps my plan is as open to objection as yours,"
answered Pelham; "but it will require no writing.
Each of us shall get a handful of beans and a handful
of peas. We can easily obtain them when the store
rooms are opened. You shall be beans, and I will be
peas."</p>

<p>"How are you, Peas?" said Shuffles, laughing at
the idea.</p>

<p>"How are you, Beans?" added Pelham.</p>

<p>"Go on with your soup."</p>

<p>"We will give to every fellow belonging to the
Chain one pea and one bean."</p>

<p>"I understand the plan now; but where are the
fellows to deposit their vegetable ballots?"</p>

<p>"We can have a receiver; appoint some good fellow
for the purpose&mdash;say, Greenway, the captain of
the forecastle; or Tom Ellis, the third master."</p>

<p>"Tom Ellis! Does he belong?"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course he does," laughed Pelham, who realized
that he had been a little too fast in betraying the
strength of his faction.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't appoint an officer."</p>

<p>"Well, you mention some fellow," said the politic
Pelham.</p>

<p>"Say Wilton."</p>

<p>"Mention another."</p>

<p>"Lynch."</p>

<p>"No; try again."</p>

<p>"Grossbeck."</p>

<p>"Very well; I will agree to him."</p>

<p>"But he might make some mistake."</p>

<p>"If he does, it will be in your favor, I suppose;
for you nominated him, and, of course, he will give
you the benefit of any doubt," replied Pelham.</p>

<p>"I want a fellow who will do it fairly. I don't
wish to get in by any mistake," said Shuffles, magnanimously.</p>

<p>"Neither do I? and I don't think there will be any
mistakes."</p>

<p>"There is a chance for a great many. The fellows
may get mixed between beans and peas. When they
come to vote, there will be some who don't know
beans," laughed Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Well, if they don't, they will know peas, which
will do just as well," replied Pelham.</p>

<p>"It would not be pleasant for me to have them
know peas, when they ought to know beans."</p>

<p>"We will give them P.P. as a clew to the whole
thing."</p>

<p>"P.P.? That means P's, I suppose."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span></p>

<p>"It means that, and more. P. for Pelham, and P.
for peas. If they get one right, they can't very well
get the other wrong."</p>

<p>"That's true," answered Shuffles, silenced, rather
than convinced, by the tactics of his fellow-conspirator.</p>

<p>It was settled that he who knew peas must certainly
"know beans."</p>

<p>"When shall the fellows vote?" asked Shuffles.</p>

<p>"After dinner to-morrow afternoon. Every fellow
will be off duty an hour in the first or second dog
watch," replied Pelham, who seemed to have an answer
ready for every question. "The polls shall be
kept open till eight o'clock. The peas and beans
shall be distributed before eight bells in the forenoon
watch, so that every fellow will be ready to vote."</p>

<p>"Where will Grossbeck stand when he receives the
ballots?"</p>

<p>"He won't stand anywhere in particular. We will
see him together, and give him his instructions. I
think it will be better for him to walk about the ship,
and let the fellows hand him the votes on the sly,
which he must put in his pocket. He shall count
them in the presence of both of us."</p>

<p>"Suppose he should lose some of them?" suggested
Shuffles.</p>

<p>"If he does, he is as likely to lose peas as beans."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be chosen in any such manner as
by the loss of the votes."</p>

<p>"I can't see that there is any more danger of his
losing them than there is of his losing his head. I
see you are not entirely satisfied with the plan."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span></p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, Pelham, I am not. There
is, at least, a chance for mistakes."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to do anything you like, that will make
the election a fairer one."</p>

<p>"I have it!" exclaimed Shuffles. "We can give
each fellow two peas and two beans, and let him vote
twice."</p>

<p>"What good will that do?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. We want another receiver; then let
each fellow vote twice, giving a pea or a bean to both
of the receivers. If the two results don't agree, it
shall not be an election."</p>

<p>"That's a first-rate idea, Shuffles, and I go in for it
with all my might," replied Pelham, with so much
warmth that his companion was put in the best of
humor. "Who shall be the other receiver?"</p>

<p>"Name some one," said Shuffles, generously conceding
the nomination to his confederate.</p>

<p>"Perth."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Shuffles objected because Pelham had done so when
he had mentioned two names.</p>

<p>"Richton."</p>

<p>"Once more."</p>

<p>"McKeon."</p>

<p>"Right. McKeon is an honest, careful fellow,"
added Shuffles. "Now I think there can be no mistake."</p>

<p>The minor details of the election were carefully
arranged, and the boys went below again. They gave
satisfactory replies to the first lieutenant, who questioned
them in regard to the steamer they had gone
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
aloft to examine. Pelham thought she was a "Cunarder,"
but Shuffles was confident she belonged to
the Inman line; and it is quite certain neither of them
had any opinion whatever in regard to her, except
that she was going west; for the red light on her port
side was visible.</p>

<p>On the following day, Grossbeck and McKeon, the
receivers who had been appointed, were waited upon,
separately, by the two "Shackles." They accepted
the important trust which was confided to them, and
each was duly and solemnly admonished of the necessity
of entire fairness. They were informed that any
discrepancy in the number of ballots in the hands of
the two receivers would cause the vote to be rejected;
and they individually promised to be both faithful and
careful.</p>

<p>The beans and the peas were readily obtained, and
were distributed among the members of the League,
with the necessary secrecy. Some of the independent
voters needed a little persuasion to induce them to
vote, when informed that the choice was between the
"Shackles" only; but they yielded the point, and
entered heartily into the excitement of the event; for,
secret as were the proceedings, they were attended
with no little exhilaration of feeling.</p>

<p>The voting commenced in the afternoon watch.
The second part of the starboard watch, being off duty,
gave in their peas and beans first. The receivers,
without even knowing all the members of the League,
took whatever was handed to them "on the sly," and
looked as careless and indifferent as though nothing
was going on. The only responsibility that rested
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
upon them, besides the general duty of carefulness
and fidelity, was to see that no one voted twice.
"Vote early and vote often" was not countenanced;
and one receiver acted as a check upon the other.</p>

<p>The election progressed so secretly that no occasion
for suspicion was given; and though the ballots were
deposited under the eyes of the principal and the professors
they saw nothing, and had not the remotest
idea that anything wrong was in progress.</p>

<p>In the last half of the first dog watch, Shuffles began
to be excited. He was too much of a politician
to be idle while any voting was going on? and so far
as his duty would permit, he had watched the receivers
since the balloting commenced. He had seen
seven or eight vote of whose membership in the Chain
he had no previous knowledge. He saw that Pelham
had made more initiates than he had been willing to
acknowledge, apparently concealing the facts for the
purpose of favoring his own election. He observed
that all the officers of his rival's quarter watch voted,
and he was almost certain that he had been defeated.</p>

<p>Shuffles was angry and indignant when he discovered
the treacherous shrewdness of his fellow-conspirator;
but he had solemnly promised to abide the
result of the election, and he could not recede from
his position without a violation of the "honor among
thieves" which is said to exist. The poll would not
be closed for half an hour; and as he had been cheated
he deemed it quite right to restore the equilibrium
by a resort to the same policy.</p>

<p>"Wilton, I have been cheated," said he, angrily, as
he met his old crony in the waist.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you know you have?"</p>

<p>"I know it. I will explain by and by. Something
must be done. I am beaten as sure as you live."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help it if you are. You and Pelham
have fixed things to suit yourselves, and now you
must fight it out between you," replied Wilton, as he
turned on his heel, and left the mighty mischief-maker
alone and disconcerted.</p>

<p>"Where do all these beans come from?" said Paul
Kendall, as he noticed the rejected ballots of the Pelhamites,
which they had not even taken the trouble to
throw over the rail.</p>

<p>"It's a new game the fellows are playing," replied
Shuffles, with apparent indifference, as he walked aft
with the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Paul, curiously.</p>

<p>"It's called 'Don't know Beans,'" answered Shuffles
in deep thought. "The fellows have a good deal
of sport out of it in the off-time."</p>

<p>"'Don't know Beans!' I never heard of such a
game before. Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"You see Grossbeck and McKeon?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, they are the <i>butts,</i> as we call them. All
the fellows in our watch have some beans," added
Shuffles, taking a handful of them from his pocket.</p>

<p>"What do they do with them?"</p>

<p>"You try it yourself. Take two of these beans."</p>

<p>Paul took them.</p>

<p>"Now you must give one to Grossbeck, and the
other to McKeon, without letting any fellow see you
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
do it. If any fellow does see you give it to either of
them, he will say, in a low tone, 'Don't know Beans,'
and then the butt must drop it on deck. When the
even bell strikes, Grossbeck and McKeon must count
their beans. The one who has the most must appoint
the next two bean-pots, or butts; and the one who has
the smaller number must pick up all the beans that
have been dropped on the deck. There is fun in it;
though, perhaps, you wouldn't think so."</p>

<p>"I will try it, at any rate."</p>

<p>Paul did try it, and succeeded, as all others did, in
giving the beans to the receivers without any one uttering
the warning words. He was rather pleased
with the game, so suddenly invented, and the two officers
of his watch were induced to try the experiment.
Then Blackburn, Endicott, and Bennington were supplied
with beans by Shuffles, who instructed his auditors
that not a word must be said about the matter to
the "butts," or to any one in the waist. The last
three were as successful as the first three. Then
Thompson and Cartwright were equally fortunate.
Finally, Captain Gordon's attention was attracted,
and he descended so far from his dignity as to deposit
the beans.</p>

<p>Shuffles was satisfied. He had procured nine votes,
and he was confident that he had thus defeated his
rival. As a matter of precaution, he directed McKeon
to pick up the beans scattered in the waist; and the
"outsiders" who had cast the nine votes believed that
he was the unlucky butt, who had been beaten in the
game.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span></p>

<p>"The captain and half the officers voted," whispered
Grossbeck at four bells.</p>

<p>"Certainly; that's all right. You and McKeon
will meet Pelham and me in the waist at eight bells,"
replied Shuffles, as he went below.</p>

<h4>THE RESULT OF THE BALLOT.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>The first part of the port watch went on duty at
eight o'clock, when the secret poll for the choice
of a captain, under the new order of events, was
closed. Shuffles was in this watch, but as neither his
"trick at the wheel" nor his turn on the lookout came
within the first hour, he had an opportunity to attend
to the important business of the League. Pelham and
the two receivers of votes belonged in the second part
of the port watch, and there was nothing to prevent
them from attending the conference which Shuffles
had appointed.</p>

<p>While Shuffles had been teaching the "outsiders"
the game of "Don't know Beans," Pelham, as officer
of the deck, remained abaft the mizzenmast, and had
failed to notice what was taking place in the waist.
The officers who were off duty, and who had unconsciously
voted for Shuffles, said nothing to those in
charge of the ship. In accordance with the requirements
of man-of-war discipline, the weather side of
the deck was given up to the captain and the officers
on duty, while all the idlers were required to keep on
the lee side. Captain Gordon was a privileged person.
On the weather side, even the denizens of the after
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
cabin did not presume to address him on any question
not connected with the discipline of the ship. When
he went over to the lee side, it was understood that he
was simply a student, and even an ordinary seaman
might speak to him when he walked forward.</p>

<p>Shuffles had explained the game to the outsiders
on the lee side, out of the hearing of the officer of
the deck; and Pelham, entirely satisfied that he was
already elected, did not trouble himself about the
matter.</p>

<p>If "Don't know Beans" was not much of a game,
it was better than nothing, and Shuffles soon found
that there was danger of his little scheme being exposed.
During the second dog watch, at supper time,
and as other opportunities were presented, he told
Wilton, Monroe, Adler, and others, that the second
lieutenant, seeing so many beans on the deck, wished
to know where they came from, and that, to deceive
him and the rest of the officers, he had invented the
game which he described, and wished them to play
while off duty on deck. "Our fellows" thought this
was a good joke, and the new pastime was soon understood
throughout the ship, and "butts" were appointed
in each quarter watch to play it the next day.</p>

<p>"The fellows have all voted, I suppose," said Pelham
when the party had obtained a good position for
the conference.</p>

<p>"The time is out, whether they have or not,"
replied Grossbeck.</p>

<p>"All we have to do now is to count the votes,"
added Shuffles, impatiently, for he was afraid his little
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
trick would be exposed before the result of the ballot
was obtained.</p>

<p>"Well, let us have it counted at once," said Pelham,
who, having no doubt of the result, had no thought of
offering any objection to the fairness of the election.</p>

<p>"We can't count the votes here," suggested McKeon.
"Some one would see us, and want to know what we
were doing."</p>

<p>"I can't leave the deck; I'm on duty," replied
Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Let the receivers count it themselves."</p>

<p>"We ought to see them do it."</p>

<p>"That is not necessary. They don't know how
many votes they have."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't," said Grossbeck.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," added McKeon.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how we can manage it, without
exciting the attention of any one."</p>

<p>"I will agree to anything that is fair," replied
Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Grossbeck shall go forward, and McKeon aft as
far as the mainmast, so that each cannot know what
the other is about. They can count the votes separately
without being seen."</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can," said McKeon.</p>

<p>"Can you tell a pea from a bean by the feeling?"</p>

<p>"Of course we can."</p>

<p>"Where did you put the votes, Grossbeck?" asked
Pelham.</p>

<p>"In my trousers' pocket."</p>

<p>"So did I," added McKeon.</p>

<p>"Both of you have on your pea-jackets now, and
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
there is a pocket on each side of them. Take out all
the peas first, and put them in the right-hand pocket
of your pea-jacket; then all the beans, and put them
in the left-hand pocket; then count each."</p>

<p>"Some fellow may see us counting them," said
Grossbeck.</p>

<p>"You must take care of that," answered Pelham.</p>

<p>"If they do, it will not make much difference.
Some of the fellows were careless, and threw their
beans on the deck."</p>

<p>"Did they?" laughed Pelham? "I suppose they
had no use for them."</p>

<p>"The second lieutenant saw them, and wanted to
know what they meant," added Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Pelham.</p>

<p>"I made it all right, though I was obliged to invent
a new game to throw him off the track."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Pelham. "But we must go on with
the counting. When you have found the number of
peas and of beans, you will write the result on a piece
of paper, each of you. McKeon, you will hand your
paper to Shuffles, and, Grossbeck, you will hand yours
to me. That's fair&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Then we will put the two papers together; if
they agree, the election is made; if they do not agree,
we must do it all over again," continued Pelham.</p>

<p>"All right," added Shuffles.</p>

<p>The two receivers were sent away to count the
votes. As one went forward, and the other aft, and
the two "Shackles" stood between, no communication
whatever could pass from one to the other. It was
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
now quite dark, and most of those off duty had
turned in, for the students had become so well accustomed
to sea life that they could sleep whenever
their presence was not required on deck.</p>

<p>"I hope this thing will be settled now once for all,"
said Pelham, who feared that some mistake might
defeat his hopes.</p>

<p>"So do I," replied Shuffles, who was disturbed by
the same dread.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what the result will be?"
asked Pelham, who, in spite of the mutual "toggling,"
and the mutual assurances of good faith, had
some doubts whether his rival would be willing to
accept the result.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," replied Shuffles, cautiously,
and with the same want of confidence which disturbed
his companion. "There is no knowing who will be
governor till after election."</p>

<p>"Of course not, but you might have some idea of
the way the thing is going?"</p>

<p>"I might, but what's the use of talking when we
shall know all about it in ten or fifteen minutes?"</p>

<p>"Of course you have some hopes."</p>

<p>"To be sure I have; and I suppose you have, too."</p>

<p>"Certainly I have; if I hadn't, I should have
given the thing up without the trouble and risk of
a ballot," replied Pelham.</p>

<p>"We both expect it, and it follows that one of us
must be disappointed."</p>

<p>"You know the bond."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Here is my hand, Shuffles. I pledge myself over
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
again to abide the result of the vote, whether it is for me
or against me," continued Pelham, extending his hand.</p>

<p>"And here is my hand, Pelham, with the same
pledge, honor bright," replied Shuffles, as he took the
offered hand.</p>

<p>"I am tolerably confident of the result," added
Pelham.</p>

<p>"I am quite confident that I shall be chosen,"
replied Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Don't be too certain, my dear fellow," laughed the
fourth lieutenant. "I have taken in a great many
recruits."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you have&mdash;the more the better. I have
also taken in a good many. Pelham, do you know this
is very shaky business?"</p>

<p>"Shaky?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;between you and me, I mean. If either of
us should back down, the whole thing would fall to
the ground."</p>

<p>"Back down!" exclaimed Pelham. "Why, after
what has passed between us, I consider it impossible
that either of us should back down. I am pledged;
so are you; and if either of us should back down, I
hope he will&mdash;fall overboard accidentally."</p>

<p>"So do I," replied Shuffles, heartily.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, if you should back out, I should
be mad enough to help you over the rail, some dark
evening, if I had a good chance."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I should feel any better-natured if
you should break your agreement. One of us is
doomed to disappointment. We have tried to make
this thing as fair as possible."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly we have, and it will be as fair as anything
can be. I am entirely satisfied with the voting."</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am."</p>

<p>Shuffles was very glad of this acknowledgment in
advance of the reception of the result.</p>

<p>"But, after all, Pelham," said he, "there may be an
appearance of unfairness in the voting, after the result
is declared."</p>

<p>"There may be; but each of us is pledged not to
claim anything on account of such an appearance.
If the figures of the two receivers agree, that is the
end of the whole thing, and you or I will be the
captain."</p>

<p>"That's so; but here comes McKeon," replied
Shuffles, as the receiver gave him the paper on which
the result of the votes he had received was written.</p>

<p>It was too dark to see it, and the rivals waited, in
great excitement of mind, for the appearance of Grossbeck.
He came, and his paper was handed to Pelham.
The conditions of the agreement had now all
been complied with, and the two papers were to be
placed side by side, where both of the candidates
could see them at the same instant. It was necessary,
in the darkness, to obtain the use of a light for a moment
and they decided to wait till the midshipman on
duty in the waist went into the steerage to make the
half-hourly inspection.</p>

<p>When one bell struck, the officer left his post, and
the conspirators walked up to the binnacle in the
waist. By raising one of the slides in the side of the
machine, the lamp which threw its light on the face
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
of the compass would enable them to examine the
papers.</p>

<p>"Hold your paper by the side of mine," said Pelham
as he placed the important document in a position
to receive the light from the binnacle when the
slide should be moved.</p>

<p>"Open it," replied Shuffles, nervously, as he complied
with the direction of his rival.</p>

<p>Pelham raised the slide, and the contents of the
papers were read by both.</p>

<p>Peas,........19</p>

<p>Beans,........22</p>

<p>The results given in by the two receivers were the
same, and by the terms of the bond, it was an election.</p>

<p>"Shut the slide," said Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Who opened that binnacle?" demanded the first
master, walking aft from his station on the forecastle.</p>

<p>"I did, sir," replied Shuffles, unwilling to permit
the fourth lieutenant to answer the question. "We
were looking at some figures I had made."</p>

<p>The master, finding that the fourth lieutenant was
one of the party gathered around the binnacle, said no
more, and returned to his place.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied, Pelham?" asked Shuffles, in
the softest of tones.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," answered the disappointed
candidate.</p>

<p>"Don't you? Well, you will remember that neither
of us was to raise any question about the fairness of
the ballot."</p>

<p>"I don't say a word about its fairness; I only said
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
I did not understand it," answered Pelham, in surly
tones.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it any better than you do; but
the point just now is, whether you acknowledge me as
captain, or not."</p>

<p>"Of course I do. When I pledge myself to do a
thing, I always do it, I hail you as captain."</p>

<p>"All right," added Shuffles. "Then nothing more
need be said. You have kept your bond like a gentleman
and I now appoint you my first officer, as I
promised to do."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Pelham, in a sneering tone.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, my dear fellow? Are you not
satisfied?" demanded Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Entirely satisfied with the result;" but he talked
like one who was anything but satisfied.</p>

<p>"It was a fair thing&mdash;wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it was; I don't know."</p>

<p>"You speak as though you were not satisfied,
Pelham."</p>

<p>"I am not disposed to grumble. I only say that I
don't understand it."</p>

<p>"What don't you understand?" asked Shuffles,
sharply. "The election was conducted on a plan
furnished by yourself; the receivers were of your own
choice; the results agree; and I can't see, for the life
of me, that there is any chance to find fault."</p>

<p>"I don't find fault. The result perplexes me,
because I can't see through it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I don't see where your twenty-two votes came
from."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span></p>

<p>"And I don't see where your nineteen came from,"
retorted the successful candidate.</p>

<p>"The whole number of votes was forty-one," added
Pelham, who was quite sure there was something
wrong.</p>

<p>"The long and short of it is, that there are more
fellows on board that 'know beans,' than you thought
there were," laughed Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where the forty-one votes came
from, Shuffles?" demanded Pelham.</p>

<p>"Came from the fellows, of course."</p>

<p>"It's no use to snuff at it, my dear fellow. I do not
purpose to set aside the election. I acknowledge you
as captain. Can I do any more?"</p>

<p>"You can't; but you seem disposed to do something
more."</p>

<p>"I merely wish to inquire into this thing, and find
out how we stand. Had you any idea that forty-one
fellows belonged to the Chain?"</p>

<p>"I had not," replied Shuffles, honestly. "I was
never more surprised in my life, than when I saw Tom
Ellis and Andy Groom vote."</p>

<p>"That was all right. Both of them joined."</p>

<p>"I can tell you what took me all aback," interposed
McKeon, who, with Grossbeck, had been walking
back and forth in the waist.</p>

<p>"No matter what took you all aback," added Shuffles
sharply. "The question is settled; what's the
use of raking up every thing that may seem to be
strange?"</p>

<p>"What was it that took you aback, McKeon?" demanded
Pelham.<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span></p>

<p>"It was when the captain voted," replied the receiver.</p>

<p>"The captain!" exclaimed Pelham.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Captain Gordon, McKeon?" asked
Pelham, with intense surprise.</p>

<p>"Of course I do."'</p>

<p>"All the officers of the first part of the port watch
voted," added Grossbeck.</p>

<p>"They did!" exclaimed Pelham.</p>

<p>"Well, was it any stranger that the officers of the
first part of the port watch voted, than it was that
those of the second part did so?" inquired Shuffles,
with earnestness.</p>

<p>"I think it was," replied Pelham, decidedly.</p>

<p>"Paul Kendall was one of them," said McKeon.</p>

<p>"Paul Kendall! Does any fellow suppose he has
joined the Chain?" demanded the defeated candidate.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"And Captain Gordon?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"How did the captain vote?" asked Pelham.</p>

<p>"No matter how he voted," said Shuffles, indignantly
"I protest against this raking up of matters
which are already settled."</p>

<p>"He voted beans," replied McKeon, who, it is
hardly necessary to add, was a Pelham man.</p>

<p>"Then he is one of your friends, Shuffles," continued
Pelham, who was beginning to understand how
his rival had been elected.</p>

<p>"I don't claim him."</p>

<p>"Did you take the captain into the Chain, Shuffles?"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't answer," replied the captain elect.</p>

<p>"If Captain Gordon and Paul Kendall are members,
I would like to know it. I am first officer of the
ship under the new order of things, and if I command
Gordon to do anything, I mean that he shall obey me."</p>

<p>"Of course you will give him no orders till we are
in possession of the ship," added Shuffles, not a little
alarmed.</p>

<p>"Well, as Gordon and Kendall are members of the
Chain&mdash;of course they are, or they wouldn't have
voted&mdash;we can talk over the matter freely with them,"
said Pelham, chuckling.</p>

<p>"If you make the signs, and they make them, of
course you can," replied Shuffles. "No member can
speak to another about the business of the Chain until
both of them have proved that they belong, by giving
the required signals."</p>

<p>"Shuffles, do you suppose Captain Gordon knows
the signs?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? I never tried him. I don't
know why he shouldn't make them as well as Tom
Ellis."</p>

<p>"Tom Ellis is all right. I vouch for him, for I admitted
him myself. Who will vouch for the captain?
Who took him in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I don't; but if anybody has admitted him, and not
given him the signs, he ought to be instructed in them.
Of course he must have been admitted, or he would
not have voted," added Pelham, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to say about this matter,"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
replied Shuffles, disgusted with the cavils of his first
officer.</p>

<p>"Nor I; but I shall satisfy myself whether the captain
is a member or not," said Pelham, decidedly.</p>

<p>"Well, you must be very cautious what you do."</p>

<p>"Certainly I shall. I will give him the first sign;
if he don't answer it, I shall conclude he is not a
member; or, if he is, that he has not been properly
instructed."</p>

<p>"Better not say anything to him," said Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Why not? He voted, and it must be all right."</p>

<p>"Don't you say a word to him, unless he proves
that he is a member."</p>

<p>"I think he has proved that already by voting."</p>

<p>"You know our rule."</p>

<p>"I do; it requires me to satisfy myself that the
person to whom I speak is a member. I am entirely
satisfied now that the captain and Paul Kendall
belong; they would not have voted if they had not
belonged."</p>

<p>This was a "clincher," and even Shuffles had not
wit enough to escape the conclusion of the dogmatic
reasoner. The captain elect of the League knew very
well that nine persons who were not members had
voted&mdash;that he had secured his election by a gross
fraud. He was afraid that Pelham, disappointed by
his defeat, would do something to compromise the
enterprise; but his own treachery had placed him in
such a position that he could say nothing without exposing
himself.</p>

<p>"Of course it's all right," added Pelham, "I find
we have plenty of friends in the after cabin. As soon
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
as you have any orders to give, Captain Shuffles, I am
in a position to execute them to the best advantage."</p>

<p>"When I am ready, I will give them to you."</p>

<p>"It will be an easy matter now to obtain possession
of the ship; in fact, all you have to do is to order
Captain Gordon to turn the command over to you.
He has been 'toggled,' and must obey his superiors&mdash;of
course he has been toggled; he couldn't have voted
if he hadn't been."</p>

<p>Shuffles was terribly exercised by the repeated flings
of his disconcerted rival. He was already satisfied
that the enterprise had come to an end, unless Pelham
could be quieted; and he was about to propose a new
ballot, when he was ordered by the quartermaster on
duty to take his trick at the wheel.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean?" demanded Pelham of
the receivers, when the captain-elect had gone to his
duty.</p>

<p>"I only know that the captain and all the officers of
the first part of the port watch voted, and other fellows
who would no more join this thing than they would
jump overboard," replied McKeon.</p>

<p>"How could they vote&mdash;how could the captain
vote&mdash;without understanding the whole thing?" demanded
Pelham, perplexed at the inconsistency of the
facts.</p>

<p>"I think I know something about it," added Grossbeck.</p>

<p>"What do you know?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard of the new game?"</p>

<p>"What new game?"</p>

<p>"'Don't know Beans.'"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span></p>

<p>"Shuffles said something about it, but I did not
comprehend his meaning."</p>

<p>Grossbeck explained the game, whose history had
been circulated among "our fellows."</p>

<p>"And this game was played while the voting was
going on?" said Pelham, who began to see the trick
which his rival had put upon him.</p>

<p>"I didn't know anything about it till supper time,"
answered Grossbeck.</p>

<p>"I see it all," continued Pelham. "The receivers
were the 'butts,' and about a dozen fellows voted for
Shuffles, including Gordon and Kendall, supposing
they were simply playing 'Don't know Beans.'"</p>

<p>It did not require a great deal of penetration on the
part of the fourth lieutenant to comprehend the trick
of his rival. He was indignant and angry, and all the
more so because he had been outwitted, even while he
was attempting to outwit his unscrupulous competitor.</p>

<p>The next day, the quarter watches off duty played
"Don't know Beans" to their satisfaction. It was
found, when everybody was watching the "butts,"
that very few could deposit their beans without detection.
A few hours' trial of the new pastime convinced
all except "our fellows" that it was a senseless game,
and it was speedily abandoned.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth day of the voyage, the Young
America encountered another gale, but it was not
nearly so severe as the one through which she had
passed when off Cape Sable. The ship ran for twelve
hours under close-reefed topsails; but as the gale came
from the south-west, she laid her course during the
whole of it, and behaved herself to the entire satisfac
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>tion
of all on board. On the following day, the wind
had hauled round to the north-west, and the sea subsided,
so that the ship went along very comfortably.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his doubts of the good faith of
Pelham, who, however, nominally adhered to the
terms of the compact, Shuffles arranged his plans for
the capture of the ship. He had decided to defer the
grand strike until the ship had come up with Cape
Clear, so that the faculty, and all the students who
would not take a part in the enterprise, might be put
on shore immediately. In the course of three days,
the land would probably be sighted. The rising was
to take place in Pelham's watch, the officers of which
were members of the League. All the details had
been carefully arranged, and trusty "links" appointed
to perform the heavy work. As soon as the "old
folks" had been locked up in the cabin, and the new
captain had taken the command, the ship was to be
headed for the shore. The great event was to come
off at six o'clock in the afternoon of the twenty-third
or twenty-fifth day. The ship would be near the coast
for at least a part of two days. If she was within six
hours' sail of the land on the twenty-third day out,
when Pelham would have the second part of the first
dog watch, the rising was to take place then; if not,
it was to be deferred till the twenty-fifth day, when the
watches were again favorable.</p>

<p>Shuffles communicated with his discontented first
officer as often as he could, and unfolded his plans
without reserve. Pelham listened, and, still professing
his willingness to obey his superior officer, promised
to do all that was required of him.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span></p>

<p>"In your watch, Pelham, you will see that the
helm is in the hands of some of our fellows," said
Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Pelham, with more indifference
than suited the enthusiastic chief of the enterprise
"By the way, Captain Shuffles, have you laid
out any work for Captain Gordon to do?"</p>

<p>"What's the use of talking to me about him now
that we are on the very point of accomplishing our
purpose?" demanded Shuffles, with deep disgust.</p>

<p>"You can't deny that Gordon is an able fellow,
and, as a good commander, of course you intend to
give him some important position," chuckled Pelham.
"Have you appointed the rest of your officers yet?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I have."</p>

<p>"Have you given Gordon anything?"</p>

<p>"No!" growled Shuffles.</p>

<p>"No? Why, do you think the present captain of
the ship will be content to go into the steerage under
the new arrangement?"</p>

<p>"He may go into the steerage or go overboard,"
answered the chief, angrily.</p>

<p>"Accidentally, you mean."</p>

<p>"Pelham, if you intend to be a traitor, say so."</p>

<p>"I! My dear fellow, I don't mean anything of the
kind. I am as true as the pole star."</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to the captain about our affairs?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"Have you tried him by the signs?"</p>

<p>"I have, and he made no sign," laughed Pelham,
who was not much enamoured of the cabalistic clap-trap
of the Chain.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, of course, he is not a member."</p>

<p>"He must be; he voted," replied Pelham, maliciously.</p>

<p>"How many more times will you say that?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps fifty; perhaps a hundred," answered the
fourth lieutenant, coolly. "I shall say it until you are
willing to acknowledge the trick you put upon me."</p>

<p>"What trick?"</p>

<p>"O, I know all about it! Didn't you tell Kendall,
the captain, and seven or eight others, how to play
'Don't know Beans'?"</p>

<p>"If I did, it was to cheat them when they wanted
to know what the beans meant."</p>

<p>"You saw that the fellows threw away the beans,
instead of voting for you with them, and you invented
your game to make the thing come out right. No
matter, Shuffles; I am bound by the compact we
made, but I shall persist in regarding Gordon, Kendall
Foster, and others as members. As you made
them vote, you are responsible for them. That's all."</p>

<p>"Don't let us quarrel about it, my dear fellow,"
said Shuffles, in soft, insinuating tones.</p>

<p>"By no means."</p>

<p>"We will have a new election," suggested the chief.</p>

<p>"If we should, I'm afraid all the fellows would
want to play 'Don't know Beans.'"</p>

<p>"You shall conduct it any way you please."</p>

<p>"If I did, you would say I cheated you. I agreed
to abide by the election, and I shall do so. The fact
is, Shuffles, you and I are too smart to play in the
same game. I shall stick to the bond. When you
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
order me to do anything, I shall do it," replied Pelham
as he turned on his heel and walked off.</p>

<p>He retreated into the after cabin, where Shuffles
could not follow him. At the cabin table, studying
his French lesson, sat Paul Kendall.</p>

<p>"Do you know how to play 'Don't know Beans'?"
asked Pelham, as he seated himself by the
side of the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Yes; I know how to play it, but it's a stupid
game. Shuffles told me how."</p>

<p>"Did he, indeed?"</p>

<p>"There was some fun in it the first time I tried it;
but the second time was enough to satisfy me. I
don't think there is any sense in it."</p>

<p>"Of course there isn't, Kendall," laughed Pelham.
"It was no game at all."</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>"You were sold on that game," added the conspirator
indulging in more laughter than the occasion
seemed to require.</p>

<p>"How was I sold? I don't see anything so very
funny about it."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it; if there is any joke I think I
shall enjoy it. You say I was sold."</p>

<p>"You were; and so was I."</p>

<p>"Well, what was it?" asked Paul, impatiently.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span></p>

<p>"When you gave those fellows the beans that day,
you were voting!"</p>

<p>"Voting! Voting for what, or whom?" exclaimed
the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"For Shuffles."</p>

<p>"Did my vote count?"</p>

<p>"To be sure it did; and he was elected to a certain
position by your vote and those of seven or eight
others who did not understand the trick," replied Pelham
laughing all the time.</p>

<p>"What was the position? I don't understand what
you are talking about, and therefore I can't appreciate
the joke."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Kendall; but you must keep still
about it for the present."</p>

<p>"It looks to me, on the face of it, like a dishonest
trick. It seems that Shuffles lied to us when he made
us believe that we were playing a game. I like a
joke well enough, but I don't believe in a fellow's
lying for the sake of any fun."</p>

<p>"You are right, Kendall. It was not only a dishonest
trick, but it was a mean one."</p>

<p>"What was the position?" repeated Paul.</p>

<p>"Some of the fellows are going to make Mr. Lowington
a present of a silver pitcher as soon as we get
to some port where we can obtain one."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell of it?" demanded Paul. "I
should like to join in the presentation, for I don't think
there is a fellow on board who likes Mr. Lowington
better than I do."</p>

<p>"Yes; but, you see, there's something peculiar
about this thing. The contribution is to be confined
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
to those fellows who have been disciplined in one way
or another. A good many of us, you know, were
mad when Mr. Lowington took our money away; we
are satisfied now that he was right. We made him
feel rather uncomfortable by our looks and actions,
and some of us were positively impudent to him.
We purpose to show that our feelings are all right."</p>

<p>"Precisely so!" replied Paul, with enthusiasm.
"That's splendid! Mr. Lowington will appreciate
the gift when he sees the names of the subscribers."</p>

<p>"Certainly he will."</p>

<p>"But you have no money," laughed the second
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"We have put our names down for ten shillings
apiece&mdash;about thirty of us. When we get into port,
we shall tell Mr. Lowington that we wish to present
a silver pitcher to a gentleman on board, in token of
our appreciation of his kindness, &amp;c., and ask him for
half a sovereign each from our funds."</p>

<p>"He will wish to know who the gentleman is."</p>

<p>"We can ask to be excused from telling him."</p>

<p>"I can manage that part of the business for you.
Each of the fellows shall give me an order on the
principal for ten shillings, to be paid to Dr. Winstock,
who will buy the pitcher for you, if you like. He is
acquainted in Cork. I will give all the orders to the
doctor, and he will get the present without saying a
word to Mr. Lowington until after the presentation.
Then he will have no chance to object, on the suspicion
that the gift is intended for him&mdash;don't you
see?"</p>

<p>Paul Kendall entered into the project with a degree
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
of enthusiasm which was rather embarrassing to the
conspirator.</p>

<p>"The fellows have been very secret about the
thing," added Pelham.</p>

<p>"They must have been, or I should have heard
something about it," replied Paul, innocently.</p>

<p>"No one but ourselves has known a thing about it
till now. They have formed a kind of secret society,
and know each other by certain signs."</p>

<p>"But what was the voting for?"</p>

<p>"For orator of the day."</p>

<p>"For the fellow who is to present the pitcher and
make the speech?" added Paul.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And Shuffles was chosen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by a trick."</p>

<p>"You mean that no one but subscribers ought to
have voted?"</p>

<p>"Precisely so."</p>

<p>"It was a mean trick."</p>

<p>"It was a sort of practical joke upon me, I suppose"</p>

<p>"I don't believe in practical jokes which need a lie
to carry them through."</p>

<p>"Well, Shuffles has the position, unless some of
you fellows will help me out. I wanted to make the
speech, and without the nine votes which you and
other outsiders put in, I should have been chosen."</p>

<p>"What can we do?"</p>

<p>"I have a right to consider all the fellows that voted
as members of the society. The fact of their voting
makes them members."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that."</p>

<p>"It's clear enough to me, and in a talk I had with
Shuffles just now, he didn't pretend to deny the correctness
of my position."</p>

<p>"If he agrees, it must be all right," laughed Paul.</p>

<p>"If you had understood the matter, for whom should
you have voted?"</p>

<p>"I don't know? but after the trick Shuffles played
off upon you, I should not vote for him."</p>

<p>"Very well; then you can change your vote."</p>

<p>"How shall I change it?"</p>

<p>"Go to Shuffles; and the other eight fellows who
voted in the dark must do the same."</p>

<p>"What shall I say to him?"</p>

<p>"You must go to him as a member of the society,
and salute him as such."</p>

<p>"I don't know how."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. When you meet him, scratch the tip
end of your nose with the nail of your second finger
on the right hand; in this manner," continued Pelham
giving the first sign.</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;is it?" said Paul, as he imitated the
action of Pelham.</p>

<p>"Yes; that's right He will reply by taking the
lower part of his left ear between the thumb and first
finger of the left hand&mdash;so," added Pelham.</p>

<p>"I have it," answered Paul, as he made the
motions.</p>

<p>"Then you will scratch your chin with the thumb
nail of the left hand, and he will reply by blowing his
nose."</p>

<p>"Let's see if I can do all that," laughed Paul, very
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
much amused at the mystic indications of membership
In the secret association.</p>

<p>He made the signs to Pelham, who replied to them,
several times, until he was perfect in his part.</p>

<p>"All right. I will remember them," said Paul.</p>

<p>"But you haven't got the whole of it yet. When
you have made the signs, and he has answered them,
he will say, '<i>Is</i> that so?' with strong emphasis on the
first word."</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> that so?" repeated Paul.</p>

<p>"Then you will reply, '<i>That</i> is so,' with the stress
on <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> is so," added Paul.</p>

<p>"Then you must place yourself so as to look directly
forward or aft. If you look forward, he must
look aft."</p>

<p>"I understand you."</p>

<p>"Now I want to know who the other fellows were
that played 'Don't know Beans' that day."</p>

<p>"Captain Gordon was one."</p>

<p>"Will you post him up in what I have told you?"</p>

<p>"I will, and the other fellows who voted for Shuffles,
if you say so."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I wish you would. Let them all tell
him they desire to change their votes; but have them
do it one at a time."</p>

<p>Paul Kendall promised to do what was required of
him; and in the course of the following forenoon he
initiated "the outsiders who had voted for Shuffles"
in the secret machinery of the supposed society, but
in fact of the Chain League. Being off duty during
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
the second part of the afternoon watch, he encountered
Shuffles in the lee side of the waist.</p>

<p>"Well, Shuffles, we are almost up with the coast
of Ireland," said Paul, as he scratched the tip of his
nose with the second finger of his right hand, agreeably
to the instructions given him by Pelham.</p>

<p>"Yes; and I suppose by Saturday, if the wind holds
fair, we shall be off Cape Clear," replied the captain-elect,
as he took the lower part of his left ear between
the thumb and forefinger of the left hand.</p>

<p>Shuffles did not suppose that the second lieutenant
was a member of the league, and pledged to assist in
the capture of the ship; but as he had made the sign,
probably accidentally, he replied to it.</p>

<p>"There is a prospect of fair weather for some days
to come," continued Paul, as he scratched his chin
with his left hand, which was the second step towards
a recognition in the "Chain."</p>

<p>Shuffles was duly and properly astonished at this
exhibition of intelligence on the part of the officer;
and it was now quite certain that Paul had joined the
league, or that he had obtained its tremendous secrets.</p>

<p>"I hope it will be good weather now during the
rest of the passage," added the captain-elect, as he
took his handkerchief from his breast pocket and blew
his nose, for he was determined to satisfy himself
whether or not the second lieutenant was a member
of the League.</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> that so?" demanded Shuffles.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> is so," answered Paul.</p>

<p>Shuffles was almost overwhelmed with astonish
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>ment
to find that one who was a model of fidelity and
propriety had actually joined the Chain.</p>

<p>"Shuffles, I voted for you the other day," added
Paul.</p>

<p>"I know you did."</p>

<p>"I wish to change my vote."</p>

<p>"Change it!" exclaimed Shuffles.</p>

<p>"Yes? I voted in the dark. I wish now to vote for
the other candidate."</p>

<p>"For whom?"</p>

<p>"For Pelham, of course."</p>

<p>"You are too late."</p>

<p>"I think, under the circumstances, that my vote
ought to be counted on the other side, even if it
reverses the result," said Paul, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Why do you wish to vote for Pelham?" demanded
Shuffles, rather because he had nothing else to say
than because he was interested in the anticipated
reply.</p>

<p>"I don't think it was quite fair for you to obtain
my vote as you did."</p>

<p>"No matter for that. Do you think Pelham would
make a better captain than I should?"</p>

<p>"A better what?"</p>

<p>"Do you think he will command the ship any better
than I shall."</p>

<p>"Command the ship!" repeated Paul, bewildered
by this extraordinary question. "I wasn't aware that
either of you were to command the ship."</p>

<p>Shuffles, in his turn, was confounded when he
found that the second lieutenant was a member of
the "Chain" without any knowledge of its objects.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
Though he had used all the precautions required by
the League, a hint had unwittingly been given to Paul,
whose simple integrity rendered him the most dangerous
person on board to the interests of such an
institution as the Chain.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kendall, may I ask what you now suppose
you were voting for?" asked Shuffles, with easy assurance.</p>

<p>"For the orator of the day, of course," replied Paul,
who was too free from wiles or arts to make any use
of the advantage gained.</p>

<p>Indeed, he was so true himself that he was not suspicious
of others; and he did not even perceive that
he had obtained an advantage.</p>

<p>"Exactly so," added Shuffles; "for orator of the
day? but we don't speak the idea out loud, or call it
by its proper name."</p>

<p>"What did you mean by commanding the ship,
Shuffles?" laughed Kendall.</p>

<p>"I meant orator of the day. We keep this thing to
ourselves," added Shuffles, who had no idea what was
meant by his companion.</p>

<p>"Of course; I understand all about that," said Paul,
knowingly. "I don't think I had any right to vote;
and in my opinion the trick you played on Pelham
was decidedly wrong."</p>

<p>"It was merely a joke," answered Shuffles.</p>

<p>"But do you intend to use the advantage you gained
by this trick?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad of that."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span></p>

<p>"It was only for the fun of the thing," added Shuffles
at a venture.</p>

<p>"It may have been funny; but I don't think it was
honest."</p>

<p>"I didn't intend to make any use of it," continued
Shuffles. "What did Mr. Pelham say to you, Mr.
Kendall?"</p>

<p>"He told me all about it," replied Paul.</p>

<p>"Did he, indeed?"</p>

<p>"He said that you, by causing me to vote, had made
me a member."</p>

<p>"Just so."</p>

<p>Shuffles did not dare to say much, though it was
evident, from the words and the manner of the second
lieutenant, that Pelham had not yet betrayed the real
object of the Chain. If he had, the captain elect was
satisfied he would have been in irons, confined in the
brig, before that time.</p>

<p>"I told Mr. Pelham I fully approved the purpose,
and would help him out with it."</p>

<p>"What purpose?" asked Shuffles, anxious to know
what Paul meant.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do; but I wish to know precisely
what Mr. Pelham told you."</p>

<p>"He will tell you himself," laughed Paul, as he
walked aft, in order to afford the other "outsiders"
who had voted an opportunity to communicate with
Shuffles, for he perceived that they were waiting their
turns.</p>

<p>As the second lieutenant went aft, the captain went
forward on the lee side of the deck.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span></p>

<p>"Shuffles!" called Captain Gordon, as the chief
conspirator was going forward.</p>

<p>The captain elect turned and walked towards the
commander, and touched his cap with becoming
respect.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the weather?" demanded
Captain Gordon, scratching the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>Paul had instructed the "outsiders" to talk about
the weather while they went through with the mystic
routine of the signs.</p>

<p>"I think we shall have good weather," replied
Shuffles, who, though he was confounded and amazed
to be saluted from this quarter with the language of
the "Chain," dared not refuse to give the signs, after
he had done so with the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I wish to change my vote? for I don't think it
was fairly given before," said the captain, when he
had gone through all the forms of the recognition.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Captain Gordon, if you desire to do so."</p>

<p>Fortunately for Shuffles, the captain did not prolong
the conversation; for others were waiting an
opportunity to make themselves known to the conspirator.
One after another, they saluted Shuffles in the
waist, inquiring about the weather, and making the
requisite signs. The captain elect was filled with
indignation and rage against Pelham, who had played
off this trick upon him; but he was compelled to meet
all who came, and go through the signs with them,
while the "outsiders," scattered about the deck, stood
watching the motions with intense delight. He would
fain have fled, but he could not leave the deck; and
he was afraid that any impatience, or a refusal to
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
answer the signs, would involve him in a worse difficulty.</p>

<p>At last the nine illegal voters had "made themselves
known," and having requested that their votes might
be changed, Shuffles was released from torture. He
was both alarmed and indignant. He had not been
able to ascertain what was meant by "the orator of
the day;" and he began to fear that Pelham had exposed
the whole, or a part, of the real purposes of
the League. He was enraged that he had revealed
anything. Even the captain and the second lieutenant
had made all the signs, and they could not have done
so without the assistance of a traitor.</p>

<p>"It's all up with us, Wilton," said Shuffles, as they
met near the foremast.</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"Pelham has blowed the whole thing."</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed Wilton, almost paralyzed by the
information.</p>

<p>"He has. The captain and several of the officers
made all the signs to me just now. We shall spend
our time in the brig for the next month."</p>

<p>"Did Pelham do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That was mean," added Wilton, his face pale with
terror.</p>

<p>"He will fall overboard accidentally some day,"
added Shuffles, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Shuffles," protested the frightened
confederate.</p>

<p>"I will, if I get a chance."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span></p>

<p>"You will only make the matter ten times worse
than it is."</p>

<p>Monroe joined them, and was informed of the desperate
situation of the League.</p>

<p>"It's all your fault, Shuffles," said Monroe, indignantly
"I don't blame Pelham."</p>

<p>"You don't! He has told a dozen outsiders how
to make the signs, and let them into the secrets of the
Chain, for all I know."</p>

<p>"If he has, we may thank you for it, Shuffles.
You cheated him, and played a mean trick upon
him," replied Monroe. "I wouldn't have stood it if
I had been he."</p>

<p>"Pelham is a traitor, and you are another."</p>

<p>"No matter what he is, or what I am. You got
all those fellows to vote for you, and cheated him out
of the place that belonged to him."</p>

<p>"Did you think I was going to have him captain,
after I had got up the Chain, and done all the work?"</p>

<p>"You agreed to leave it out to the fellows who
should be captain. They voted, and you cheated,"
added Monroe. "I've had enough of the Chain; and
if any fellow makes the signs again, I shall not notice
them."</p>

<p>"Humph! It's a pretty time to talk so, after the
whole thing is let out."</p>

<p>"Well, I will face the music, and get out of it the
best way I can. I was a fool to join the Chain."</p>

<p>"So was I," said Wilton.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in arriving at such a conclusion
after the affair had been exposed; and the
sentiments of Wilton and Monroe were, or would
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
soon be, the sentiments of all the members of the
League. Shuffles realized the truth of the old adage,
that rats desert a sinking ship, and he began to feel
lonely in his guilt and his fear of exposure. But he
could not forgive Pelham for his perfidy, forgetting
that each had been treacherous to the other.</p>

<p>In the first dog watch on that day, while Shuffles'
heart was still rankling with hatred towards the alleged
traitor, the rivals met in the waist, which was
common ground to officers off duty and seamen.</p>

<p>"I want to see you, Pelham," said Shuffles, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>"Well, you do see me&mdash;don't you?" laughed Pelham
who, feeling that he was now even with his
rival, was in excellent humor.</p>

<p>"Things are going wrong with us."</p>

<p>"O, no; I think not."</p>

<p>"Will you meet me on the top-gallant forecastle,
where we shall not be disturbed?" asked Shuffles.</p>

<p>"That is not exactly the place for an officer."</p>

<p>"You are off duty, and you can go where you
please."</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"I want to have an understanding."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think we have too many members&mdash;don't
you?" asked Pelham, lightly.</p>

<p>"The more the better."</p>

<p>"I'll meet you there."</p>

<p>Shuffles went to the place designated at once, where
he was soon followed by the fourth lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Well, Shuffles, what is it?" demanded Pelham,
as, with one hand on the sheet of the fore-topmast
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
staysail, he looked over the bow at the bone in the
teeth of the ship.</p>

<p>"What is it? Don't you know what it is?" replied
Shuffles, angrily.</p>

<p>"Upon my life, I don't know."</p>

<p>"You have been a traitor," exclaimed Shuffles, with
savage earnestness.</p>

<p>"O! have I?"</p>

<p>"You know you have."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would be willing to tell me wherein
I have been a traitor," added Pelham, laughing; for
he was enjoying the scene he had witnessed in the
waist, when, one after another, the "outsiders" had
made the signs to his rival.</p>

<p>"You have betrayed the secrets of the Chain."</p>

<p>"Have I?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you give the signs to Paul Kendall, the
captain, and half a dozen others?"</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow, they are members," replied
Pelham, chuckling.</p>

<p>"They are not? and you know they are not."</p>

<p>"But, Shuffles, just consider that all of them voted
for you."</p>

<p>"I don't care for that."</p>

<p>"I do. You recognized them as members first,
and I couldn't do less than you did."</p>

<p>"You are a traitor!" said Shuffles, red in the face
with passion; and the word hissed through his closed
teeth.</p>

<p>"Well, just as you like: we won't quarrel about
the meaning of words," replied Pelham, gayly; for
he enjoyed the discomfiture of his rival, and felt that
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
Shuffles deserved all he got, for the foul play of which
he had been guilty on the ballot.</p>

<p>"You pledged yourself to be honest, and stand by
the vote, fair or foul."</p>

<p>"Very true, my dear fellow? and I do so. Give
me your orders, and I will obey them."</p>

<p>"But you have exposed the whole thing," retorted
Shuffles. "What can we do now, when Kendall and
the captain know all about it?"</p>

<p>"They don't know any more than the law allows.
Besides, they are members. Didn't they vote for you?
Didn't they know beans?" continued Pelham, in the
most tantalizing of tones.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to insult me?" demanded Shuffles,
unable to control his rage.</p>

<p>"Not I. I respect you too much. You are the
captain&mdash;that is to be&mdash;of the ship," laughed Pelham.
"The captain, the second lieutenant, and all
the flunkies, voted for you? and, of course, I couldn't
be so deficient in politeness as to insult one who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment Pelham removed his hand from
the sheet, and Shuffles, irritated beyond control at the
badinage of his companion, gave him a sudden push,
and the fourth lieutenant went down into the surges,
under the bow of the ship.</p>

<p>As Pelham disappeared beneath the waves, Shuffles
was appalled at his own act; for even he had not
sunk so low as to contemplate murder. The deed was
not premeditated. It was done on the spur of angry
excitement, which dethroned his reason. The chief
conspirator had so often and so lightly used the language
of the League, about "falling overboard acci
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>dentally,"
that he had become familiar with the idea;
and, perhaps, the deed seemed less terrible to him
than it really was. When the act was done, on the
impulse of the moment, he realized his own situation,
and that of his victim. He would have given anything
at that instant, as he looked down upon the dark
waves, to have recalled the deed; but it was too late.
Self-reproach and terror overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>"Man overboard!" he shouted with desperation,
as he threw off his pea-jacket, and dived, head foremost,
from the forecastle into the sea.</p>

<p>His first impulse had been to do a foul deed; his
next, to undo it. Shuffles was a powerful swimmer.
The ocean was his element. He struck the water
hardly an instant after Pelham; and the ship, which
was under all sail, making nine knots, hurried on her
course, leaving the rivals to buffet the waves unaided.</p>

<p>"Man overboard!" cried officers and seamen, on
all parts of the ship's deck.</p>

<p>"Hard down the helm, quartermaster! Let go the
life-buoys!" shouted Kendall, who was the officer of
the deck.</p>

<p>"Hard down, sir. Buoy overboard," replied Bennington
the quartermaster at the helm.</p>

<p>"Clear away the third cutter!" added Kendall.</p>

<p>The orders were rapidly given for backing the main-topsail,
while the courses were clewed up; but the ship
went on a considerable distance before her headway
could be arrested.</p>

<p>When Pelham went down into the water, he had
been injured by the fall; and though he struck out to
save himself, it was not with his usual skill and vigor;
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
for, like his companion in the water, he was a good
swimmer. Shuffles had struck the waves in proper
attitude, and was in condition to exert all his powers
when he came to the surface. He swam towards
Pelham, intent upon rendering him the assistance he
might require.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to drown me?" gasped Pelham,
who supposed his rival had followed him overboard
for the purpose of completing his work.</p>

<p>"I mean to save you, Pelham," replied Shuffles.
"Can you swim?"</p>

<p>"I'm hurt."</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, and I will support you."</p>

<p>Shuffles took the offered hand of Pelham, who was
able to swim a little, and supported him till they could
reach the life-buoy, which had been dropped from the
stern of the ship when the alarming cry was given.</p>

<p>"Where are you hurt?" asked Shuffles, as soon as
they had grasped the buoy.</p>

<p>"My stomach struck the water," replied Pelham,
faintly.</p>

<p>The third cutter had been lowered into the water as
soon as the ship's headway was stopped, and was now
within a few yards of the buoy.</p>

<p>"Will you forgive me, Pelham? I was beside myself,"
said Shuffles, when his companion had recovered
breath after his exertions.</p>

<p>"You have saved me, Shuffles. I should have gone
down without you."</p>

<p>"Will you forgive me?" pleaded the penitent. "I
did not mean to injure you."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind it; we won't say a word about it,"
answered Pelham, as the boat came up.</p>

<p>They were assisted into the cutter, and the oarsmen
pulled back to the ship. When the party reached the
deck, a cheer burst from a portion of the crew; but
Wilton, Monroe, and a few others, believing that Pelham
had "fallen overboard accidentally," were appalled
at the probable consequences of the event.</p>

<p>Pelham was assisted to the after cabin, where Dr.
Winstock immediately attended him. He was not
seriously injured; and the next day he was able to be
on deck, and do duty.</p>

<p>"How was that?" asked Wilton, when Shuffles
had changed his clothes, and warmed himself at the
stove, as they met in the waist.</p>

<p>Shuffles looked sad and solemn. He made no
reply.</p>

<p>"Did he fall overboard accidentally?" demanded
Wilton.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me."</p>

<p>"You jumped in after him, and saved him, they
say," added Wilton; "so, I suppose, it was really an
accident."</p>

<p>Shuffles still made no reply.</p>

<h4>THE END OF THE CHAIN LEAGUE.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>


<p>The fact that Shuffles had plunged into the sea,
and labored so effectively for the rescue of the
fourth lieutenant, blinded the eyes of "our fellows,"
who, knowing the penalty of treachery to the "Chain,"
might otherwise have suspected that he had "fallen
overboard accidentally," or, in other words, that he
had been pushed into the water by his unscrupulous
rival. Wilton, Monroe, and Adler, had discussed
the matter, and reached the conclusion that Pelham
had been knocked over by the shaking of the staysail
sheet, or that he had really fallen accidentally.
They had been appalled and horrified by the event;
and those who were disgusted with the League were
not disposed to betray its secrets; for it was possible,
though not probable, that the mishap which had befallen
Pelham was an incident in the history of the
"Chain."</p>

<p>When a wicked man or a wicked boy exceeds his
average wickedness, the excess sometimes produces a
moral reaction. A person who tipples moderately
may have the drunkard's fate vividly foreshadowed to
him by getting absolutely drunk himself, and thus be
induced to abandon a dangerous practice. That
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
loathsome disease, small pox, sometimes leaves the
patient better than it finds him; and through, and
on account of, the vilest sin may come the sinner's
reformation.</p>

<p>Shuffles had exceeded himself in wickedness; and
the fact that his foul design was not even suspected by
any other person than his intended victim did not diminish
his self-reproaches. He shuddered when he
thought of the remorse which must have gnawed his
soul during the rest of his lifetime if Pelham had been
drowned. He would have been a murderer; and
while so many knew the penalty of treachery to the
League, he could hardly have escaped suspicion and
detection.</p>

<p>A reaction had been produced in his mind; but it
was not a healthy movement of the moral nature. It
was not so much the awful crime he had impulsively
committed, as the terrible consequences which would
have followed, that caused him to shrink from it. It
was an awful crime, and his nature revolted at it. He
could not have done it without the impulse of an insane
passion; but it was dreadful because it would
have shut him out from society; because it would have
placed the mark of Cain upon him; because the dungeon
and the gallows were beyond it,&mdash;rather than
because it was the sacrifice of a human life, of one
created in the image of God.</p>

<p>Shuffles was in a state of terror, as one who has
just escaped from an awful gulf that yawned before
him. He was not sincerely penitent, as one who feels
the enormity of his offence. He was not prepared to
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
acknowledge his sin before God, whose law he had
outraged.</p>

<p>When Pelham came on deck, on the day after the
exciting event, he greeted Shuffles with his accustomed
suavity, and seemed not to bear any malice in his heart
against the author of his misfortune. Officers and seamen
as well as the principal and the professors, congratulated
him upon his escape from the peril which
had menaced him; and all commended Shuffles for
his prompt and noble efforts in rescuing him. Pelham
dissented from none of their conclusions, and
was as generous in his praise of the deliverer as the
occasion required.</p>

<p>Shuffles was rather astonished to find himself a
lion on board, and at being specially thanked by Mr.
Lowington for his humane exertions in saving a shipmate.
He was so warmly and so generously commended
that he almost reached the conclusion himself
that he had done a good thing. He was not satisfied
with himself. He was in the power of Pelham, who,
by a word, could change the current of popular sentiment
and arraign him for the gravest of crimes. If
the fourth lieutenant spoke, Shuffles realized that he
should be shunned and despised, as well as hated and
feared, by all on board the ship. It was quite natural,
therefore, for him to desire a better understanding
with Pelham.</p>

<p>The League had fallen into contempt, at least for
the present. Even "our fellows" would not have
spirit enough to strike the blow; besides, the terrible
gulf from which Shuffles had just escaped was too
vivid in his mind to permit him to place himself on
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
the brink of another. So far the reaction was salutary.</p>

<p>"When may I see you, Mr. Pelham?" said Shuffles
as they came together in the waist.</p>

<p>"We will visit the top-gallant forecastle again, and
see if we can understand how I happened to fall overboard
for really I'm not in the habit of doing such
things," replied Pelham, with a smile.</p>

<p>They walked forward together, and mounted the
ladder to the place indicated.</p>

<p>"Shuffles, I never paid much attention to the snapper
of the toggle before, and never supposed it meant
anything in particular," continued Pelham, as he
placed himself in the position he had occupied before
he went over the bow. "Am I in any danger
now?"</p>

<p>"No, Pelham, no!" replied Shuffles, earnestly.
"You provoked me so by your cool taunts that I
pushed you over before I thought what I was about."</p>

<p>"Did you really mean to drown me?"</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, I did not. If you knew how I felt
when I saw you strike the water, and realized what I
had done, you would forgive me."</p>

<p>"I have done that already, Shuffles."</p>

<p>"I would have given my own life for yours at that
instant, Pelham."</p>

<p>"You saved me, after all, Shuffles. When I went
over, I either hit the side of the ship, or struck my
stomach on the water, for all the breath seemed to be
knocked out of me. I hardly knew what I was about
in the water till I saw you. At first I supposed you
had jumped overboard to finish your job."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span></p>

<p>"You wronged me; I would have saved you, if I
had been sure of perishing myself."</p>

<p>"You did save me, and I am willing to let that act
offset the other."</p>

<p>"I'm grateful to you for this, Pelham. You treat
me better than I deserve."</p>

<p>"Never mind it now; we will call it square," replied
Pelham, lightly. "How about the Chain, Shuffles?
We shall be in sight of land by to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We can't do anything now."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"How can we? After what has happened, I will
not reproach you for what you did. You know how
you provoked me. You have exposed the whole
affair to the officers."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Did you ever know Augustus
Pelham to violate his obligations?" demanded Pelham
with dignity.</p>

<p>"Never before; but the captain, the second lieutenant
and seven others, who would no more join the
League than they would steal your pocket-book, went
through all the signs with me."</p>

<p>"They all voted too," laughed Pelham.</p>

<p>"I am willing to confess that I played off a mean
trick upon you."</p>

<p>"And I have only made myself even with you. I
have not betrayed a single secret of the Chain to any
one not posted&mdash;except the signs. If I had, of course
you and I would both have been in the brig before
this time."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span></p>

<p>"I was puzzled to find nothing was said," added
Shuffles.</p>

<p>"No one knows anything. The Chain is as perfect
as ever. Give me your orders, and I will carry them
out."</p>

<p>"The fellows have backed out now."</p>

<p>"Then, of course, we must do the same. I doubt
whether we could have carried the thing out."</p>

<p>"No matter whether we could or not; we must
drop it for the present. The fellows all suppose they
are caught now, and expect every moment to be hauled
up to the mast for an investigation."</p>

<p>"They are all safe; at least we can purchase their
safety for ten shillings apiece," laughed Pelham.</p>

<p>"Purchase it!" exclaimed Shuffles, mystified by
the language of his companion.</p>

<p>"Just so&mdash;purchase it," added Pelham; and he
proceeded to inform his late rival of the trick he had
invented in retaliation for the one Shuffles had put
upon him.</p>

<p>"It was tit for tat," said Shuffles.</p>

<p>"I told nothing which would harm either of us,
for I am just as deep in the mud as you are in the
mire."</p>

<p>"That's true. We must hang together."</p>

<p>"I hope not," replied Pelham, laughing. "We
have got into this scrape, and we must get out of it."</p>

<p>"Suppose the captain or the second lieutenant
should make the signs to one of our fellows, and he
should tell what we were going to do."</p>

<p>"I told all my recruits not to answer any signs now,
whoever made them."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span></p>

<p>"I did the same, when I found the captain knew
them."</p>

<p>"Then we are safe; but the silver pitcher must be
forthcoming."</p>

<p>"The fellows will all be glad enough to get out of
this scrape by paying ten shillings."</p>

<p>"Very well; then every one of them must sign an
order on Mr. Lowington for ten shillings, payable to
Dr. Winstock," added Pelham.</p>

<p>"They will do it. Are you sure nothing has leaked
out?"</p>

<p>"Very sure; there would have been a tremendous
commotion before this time, if our real object had
been even suspected."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that."</p>

<p>"After all, Shuffles, do you really think we intended
to take the ship?"</p>

<p>"I did; I know that."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I did," said the fourth lieutenant.
"Nothing seemed exactly real to me, until I went
overboard."</p>

<p>"It was more real to me then than ever before,"
replied Shuffles. "What shall we do with the Chain
now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; we may want to use it again, some
time. Let every fellow keep still. When the principal
gets his silver pitcher, which the doctor will procure
as soon as he can go up to Cork, he will think
the members of the Chain are the best fellows on
board."</p>

<p>"I think you have sold the whole of us, Pelham,"
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
continued Shuffles, with a sheepish smile. "Here's
the end of the Chain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and we may be thankful that it isn't the end
of a rope instead of a chain," laughed Pelham. "The
penalty of mutiny is death."</p>

<p>"I have had no fear of that; it would have been
regarded only as a lark. But it is really amusing to
think where we have come out," added Shuffles. "We
formed the 'Chain' because Lowington was tyrannical;
most of the fellows joined it because he took
their money from them."</p>

<p>"Precisely so."</p>

<p>"And we are going to end it by giving Lowington
a silver pitcher, in token of our respect and esteem!"</p>

<p>"In other words, Shuffles, we have played this
game, and whipped out each other, without any help
from the principal. It was mean business&mdash;I really
think so; and while we were trying to overreach
each other, the game slipped through our fingers.
I am really grateful when I think what an awful
scrape we have avoided."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," replied Shuffles, thoughtfully;
"but there was fun in the scheme."</p>

<p>"There might have been, if we had succeeded; but
it would have been anything but fun if we had failed.
Some of us would have found quarters in the brig,
and we should not have been allowed to go on shore
when we reached Queenstown."</p>

<p>"A fellow won't want to go on shore without any
money," growled Shuffles, who was not wholly cured
of his discontent.</p>

<p>"Since I went overboard I have been thinking a
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
great deal of this matter. I have come to the conclusion
that Mr. Lowington is not the worst man in the
world."</p>

<p>"He is harsh and tyrannical."</p>

<p>"I don't think he ought to have taken our money
from us; but I judge him from all his acts, not by one
alone."</p>

<p>Pelham seemed to have turned over a new leaf, and
to be sincerely sorry for his attitude of rebellion.
Shuffles was not to be convinced; he was to be overwhelmed
in another manner.</p>

<p>The rivals separated, with their differences removed
and with full confidence in each other. Pelham
wrote thirty-one orders on the principal for ten
shillings each, in favor of the surgeon, during his off-time
on that day, which were to be signed and handed
to Paul Kendall. As opportunity occurred, the "situation"
was explained to the members of the League;
and though many of them growled at the idea of
giving a present to Mr. Lowington for taking their
money from them, not one of them refused to sign
the orders; none of them dared to refuse.</p>

<p>In due time Dr. Winstock had possession of all these
little drafts, amounting in the aggregate to fifteen
pounds, ten shillings, which would purchase quite a
respectable piece of plate. Paul Kendall was the
happiest student on board, for the presentation heralded
the era of good feeling. The League was
virtually dead for the present, if not forever. The
inherent evil of the organization, with the bickerings
and bad passions of its members, had killed it&mdash;the
turtle had swallowed his own head.
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span></p>

<p>The weather continued fine; the routine of ship's
duty and the studies went on without interruption. On
the twenty-fourth day out, at three bells in the afternoon
watch, a tremendous excitement was created on
board.</p>

<p>"Land on the port bow!" shouted one of the crew,
who had been stationed on the fore yard-arm as a
lookout.</p>

<p>All on deck sprang into the rigging, to get a sight
of the welcome shore. It looked like a fog bank in
the distance; there was really nothing to be seen, but
the fact that the ship was in sight of land was enough
to create an excitement among the boys.</p>

<p>At three bells, in the first dog watch, the land was
distinctly visible. It was the Island of Dursey, and
was now seen on the beam, while other land appeared
in sight ahead. It was Sunday, and all hands were at
liberty to enjoy this first view of the new continent.
The boys thought the land looked just like that they
had last seen on the shore of the western continent,
and perhaps some of them were disappointed because
everything looked so natural.</p>

<p>The officers and crew were impatient to make their
destined port; but the wind subsided as the sun went
down on that quiet Sabbath day on the ocean. The
ship hardly made twenty miles before daylight in the
morning.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock, on Monday, when Paul Kendall
had the deck, the Young America was off Fastnet
Rock, and not more than half a mile from it. It is
about ten miles from Cape Clear, and is a solitary
rock rising out of the sea, on which a lighthouse is
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
located. The water around it was covered with small
boats engaged in fishing. The port watch were all on
deck, and the scene was full of interest to them. The
people whom they saw belonged to another continent
than that in which they lived. All was new and
strange to them, and all were interested in observing
the distant shore, and the objects near the ship.</p>

<p>At one bell in the afternoon watch, when the Young
America was off Gally Head, all hands were piped to
muster. Mr. Lowington, on taking the rostrum, said
that he had received a petition signed by a majority of
the officers and crew.</p>

<p>"A petition to go ashore, I suppose," said Shuffles
to Pelham.</p>

<p>"I think not," laughed the fourth lieutenant, who
appeared to know what was coming.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen," continued the principal, whose
face wore an unusually pleasant smile, "a few days
since you were all filled with admiration at the noble
conduct of one of your number, who saved the life of
another at the peril of his own."</p>

<p>"Want to go ashore, Shuffles?" whispered Pelham.</p>

<p>Shuffles was too much confused to make any reply;
he did not know whether he was to be praised or
blamed.</p>

<p>"I have received a petition, requesting me to appoint
Robert Shuffles second lieutenant of the ship, in place
of Paul Kendall, resigned," added Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>Shuffles was overwhelmed with astonishment, and a
large proportion of the students received the announcement
with hearty applause.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, I have only to say that the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
petition is granted. I ought to add, however, that no
officer will lose his rank, except Mr. Kendall, who, at
his own desire, will take the vacant number in the
steerage, now belonging to Robert Shuffles, promoted.
I take great pleasure in granting this petition, because
the request is honorable to you, and shows a proper
appreciation of the noble conduct of your shipmate.
But let me add, that you should divide your admiration
between the one who rescued his friend from
death, and him who voluntarily resigned his honorable
position in the after cabin, in order to make a place in
which merit could be acknowledged and rewarded.
Nothing but a matter of life and death could have
induced me to vary the discipline of the ship. Young
gentlemen, you are dismissed from muster."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Paul Kendall!" shouted one of
the boys.</p>

<p>They were given.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Robert Shuffles!" added Paul;
and they were given.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shuffles will repair to the after cabin, where
he will be qualified, and take his position at once."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lowington, I must decline Mr. Kendall's
generous offer," interposed Shuffles, who was actually
choking with emotion.</p>

<p>"This matter has been well considered, Shuffles,"
replied the principal; "and as it is the desire of a
large majority of your shipmates that you should
accept the position, I think you had better do so."</p>

<p>"There isn't a student in the ship who desires it
so much as I do," added Paul, with generous enthusiasm
"You know I told you I would like
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
to be in the steerage, for I have always been an
officer."</p>

<p>"Allow me till to-night, if you please, to consider
it, Mr. Lowington," replied Shuffles, as he grasped
the hand of Paul.</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you desire it."</p>

<p>Shuffles was overwhelmed by the magnanimity of
Paul and the kindness of the principal. At that
moment he would have given everything to be such
a young man as the second lieutenant; to be as good
and true, as free from evil thoughts and evil purposes,
as he was. A light had dawned upon the rebel and
the plotter which he had never seen before. Goodness
and truth had vindicated themselves, and overwhelmed
the guilty one.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shuffles, I congratulate you on your promotion,"
said the chaplain, extending his hand.</p>

<p>"I cannot accept it, sir," replied the repentant malcontent
"I would like to speak with you alone, Mr.
Agneau."</p>

<p>The chaplain took him to his state room in the
main cabin? and there, Shuffles, conquered and subdued
by the kindness of his friends, confessed the
terrible crime he had committed&mdash;that he had pushed
Pelham overboard.</p>

<p>The chaplain was confounded at this confession,
but still more so when the self-convicted conspirator
revealed all the secrets of "The Chain." Shuffles
mentioned no names; he took all the guilt upon
himself.</p>

<p>"I am astonished, my dear young friend," said the
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
chaplain. "Is it possible the life you saved was
imperilled by your own violent passions?"</p>

<p>"It is true, sir," replied Shuffles, hardly able to
control his feelings.</p>

<p>"Then I think you had better not accept the
promotion that has been offered to you."</p>

<p>"I will not; I would jump overboard first. I am
willing to be punished; I deserve it."</p>

<p>"Shuffles, you have almost atoned for your errors
by confessing them; and your courageous conduct,
after you had pushed Pelham into the sea, proves that
you sincerely repented that act. Shall I tell Mr.
Lowington what you have said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; let him know me as I am; let him
despise me as I deserve," replied Shuffles, wiping
away a genuine tear of repentance.</p>

<p>Mr. Agneau talked to the penitent for two hours;
and finally he prayed with him and for him. If never
before, the moral condition of the culprit was now
hopeful, and the chaplain labored earnestly and faithfully
to give him right views of his relations to God
and his fellow-beings.</p>

<p>"Paul," said Shuffles, when he met his generous
and self-sacrificing friend in the waist, after the conference
in the state room, "I am the meanest and
vilest fellow on board."</p>

<p>"No, you are not!" exclaimed Paul.</p>

<p>"I would give the world to be like you."</p>

<p>"No, no! You wrong yourself, and overdo me."</p>

<p>"I have confessed all to the chaplain, and you will
soon know me as I am, Paul. I will not take your
place in the cabin. Your kindness and generosity
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
have overcome me. You have convinced me that
doing right is always the best way."</p>

<p>Paul did not know what to make of this remarkable
confession; but, after supper, all hands were piped to
muster again, the ship being off Kinsale Head, nearly
becalmed. The chaplain had informed the principal
of the substance of Shuffles' confession. Mr. Lowington
laughed at "The Chain League," the signs and
the passwords, and regarded the mutiny as a matter
of little consequence. He did not believe that Shuffles
or his followers, had really intended to take the
ship. The project was too monstrous to be credible.
The fact that the conspirator had attempted the life of
his companion was a grave matter, and it was treated
as such. Mr. Agneau was entirely confident of the
sincerity of the culprit's repentance. Shuffles had
refused to take the proffered promotion, which was
abundant evidence that he was in earnest.</p>

<p>The penitent was sent for, and repeated his confession
to the principal. He did not ask to be exempted
from punishment; but he did ask to be forgiven. He
was forgiven; but when the crew were piped to muster
all the particulars of the intended mutiny were
exposed to the astonished "outsiders." Paul understood
it now. Mr. Lowington ridiculed the mutiny;
but he spoke very seriously of the consequences of
insubordination.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, Shuffles has not mentioned the
name of a single student in connection with this silly
conspiracy; he has asked to be excused from doing
so. I grant his request, and I hope that all who have
engaged in the affair are as sincerely sorry for their
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
connection with it as he is. Under the circumstances,
Shuffles will not be promoted. Young gentlemen,
you are dismissed."</p>

<p>"Shuffles was a good fellow to keep us in the dark,"
whispered Sanborn to Wilton.</p>

<p>"Keep still," replied Wilton. "We are lucky to get
out of the scrape on any terms."</p>

<p>So thought all of them; and it was certainly magnanimous
on the part of the chief conspirator to be
willing to assume all the guilt, and suffer all the punishment.
There was enough of good in Shuffles to
save him from the evil of his nature.</p>

<p>"Paul, there is one more thing I must tell you,"
said Shuffles, that evening, while the ship lay becalmed
off Kinsale. "You remember when I told you about
the gambling in the steerage?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"I was deceiving you then. I only exposed the
fellows in order to make trouble. I knew that the
students would be closely watched, and the rules
more strictly enforced, which would make them
mad."</p>

<p>"What did you want to make them mad for?"</p>

<p>"So that they would join the League."</p>

<p>"Well, you did a good thing for the ship and for
the fellows, if your motives were not good," replied
Paul. "It was good out of evil, any way."</p>

<p>"I don't think half so many fellows would have
joined if Mr. Lowington hadn't taken their money
from them."</p>

<p>"Have you seen any gambling since?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, Paul."
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad to know that."</p>

<p>"One thing more; you know all the members of
the League, Paul."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes? you have their names on the orders, for ten
shillings each."</p>

<p>"So I have; but we will make a general affair of
the presentation, and that will cover up the whole of
them."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Paul. You despise me as much as I
like and respect you."</p>

<p>"I don't despise you, Shuffles. You have done
wrong, but I respect you for undoing the evil you
had meditated. We are all weak and erring, and
we can't afford to despise any one. On the contrary
I like you," replied Paul, giving Shuffles his
hand.</p>

<p>"You treat me better than I deserve, Paul; but if
you are my friend, I shall be all the better for it; and
I hope you will not be worse."</p>

<p>The end of the conspiracy had been reached.
Before the ship came to anchor in the Cove, every
boy on board had drawn his order on the principal
for ten shillings, and the members of the League were
veiled beneath the mass of names.</p>

<p>At sunrise, on Tuesday morning, the ship had a gentle
breeze; and at three bells in the forenoon watch,
she was off Roches Point, with the Union Jack at the
foremast-head, as a signal for a pilot. On this exciting
occasion, the studies and recitations were suspended
to enable all the students to see the shores,
and enjoy the scene. The pilot made his appearance,
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
gave Mr. Lowington the latest Cork papers, and took
charge of the ship. The honest Irishman was not a
little surprised to find the vessel manned "wid nothing
in the wide wurld but by's;" but he found they were
good seamen.</p>

<p>The Young America ran into the beautiful bay
through the narrow opening, with Carlisle Fort on the
starboard and Camden Fort on the port hand. The
students were intensely excited by the near view of
the land, of the odd little steamers that: went whisking
about, and the distant view of Queenstown, on the
slope of the hill at the head of the bay. They were
in Europe now.</p>

<p>"All hands to bring ship to anchor!" said the
first lieutenant, when the ship was approaching the
town.</p>

<p>The light sails were furled, the port anchor cleared
away, and every preparation made for the mooring
Then the orders to let go the topsail sheets,
clew up the topsails, and haul down the jib, were
given.</p>

<p>"Port the helm! Stand clear of the cable! Let
go the port anchor!"</p>

<p>The cable rattled through the hawse-hole, the
anchor went to the bottom, the Young America swung
round, and her voyage across the ocean was happily
terminated. Three rousing cheers were given in
honor of the auspicious event, and when the sails had
been furled, the crew were piped to dinner.</p>

<p>And here, at the close of the voyage, we leave the
Young America, with her officers and crew wiser and
better, we trust, than when they sailed from the shores
<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
of their native country. They were now to enter
upon a new life in foreign lands; and what they
saw and what they did, on sea and shore, during the
following weeks, will be related in "SHAMROCK
AND THISTLE, or <i>Young America in Ireland and
Scotland</i>!"</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
